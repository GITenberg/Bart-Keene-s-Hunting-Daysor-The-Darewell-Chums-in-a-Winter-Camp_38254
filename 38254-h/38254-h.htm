<h1>BART KEENE&rsquo;S HUNTING<br />
DAYS</h1>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I"></a>CHAPTER I</h2>

<h3>A MIDNIGHT EXPEDITION</h3>


<p>&ldquo;Hold on there! Go easy, now, fellows,&rdquo; cautioned
Bart Keene to his two chums, as they stole
softly along in the darkness. &ldquo;What are you making
all that racket for, Ned?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t me; it was Frank.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t help it,&rdquo; came from Frank Roscoe in
a whisper. &ldquo;I stumbled on a stone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t do it again,&rdquo; retorted Bart. &ldquo;First
thing you know some one will hear us, and the jig
will be up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And then we can&rsquo;t play the joke on Stumpy,&rdquo;
added Ned Wilding.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo; went on Bart. &ldquo;Easy now.
Come on. Keep behind me in a line, and walk in the
shadows as much as possible. We&rsquo;re almost there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The three lads bent upon playing a peculiar trick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
on their chum, Fenn, or &ldquo;Stumpy&rdquo; Masterson, kept
on toward the Darewell High School, at which they
were students. The building set well back from the
street, and the campus in front was now flooded
with brilliant moonlight. It was close to midnight,
and to approach the institution unobserved, to take
from it certain objects, and to steal away without
having been noticed, was the object of the three
conspirators.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you coming?&rdquo; asked Bart, as he turned
around to observe what progress his companions
were making. He saw Ned and Frank standing
still, crouched in the shadow of a leafless tree.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; he continued, somewhat anxiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thought I heard a noise in the building,&rdquo;
whispered Frank, hoarsely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re dreaming,&rdquo; retorted Bart. &ldquo;Come on.
It&rsquo;s getting late, and we want to finish.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and it&rsquo;s as cold as Greenland,&rdquo; added Ned.
The boys had on light overcoats, for winter was
near at hand.</p>

<p>Once more the two advanced, and joined Bart.
The three were now in the shadow of one of the
wings of the school, and, as far as they knew, had
not been seen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Which way are you going in?&rdquo; asked Ned, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
Bart, who was leading this midnight expedition.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Through the side court, and in at the girls&rsquo; door.
That&rsquo;s most always open, as Riggs, the janitor, lives
on that side of the school, and he doesn&rsquo;t take the
trouble to lock the door, as his house is so near.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good idea,&rdquo; commented Frank. &ldquo;Lead on, Falstaff,
an&rsquo; may he who&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cut it out,&rdquo; advised Bart sharply. &ldquo;This is no
time to spout Shakespeare stuff.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Once more the three advanced. Suddenly Bart
stopped, and Ned, who was close behind, collided
with him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong now?&rdquo; whispered Ned, as soon as
he caught his breath.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; cautioned Bart. &ldquo;I saw a man just
then! He was right by the front door of the
school.&rdquo; Bart had come to a halt in the shadow of a
buttress, just before stepping across an open space
that led to the court.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A man,&rdquo; murmured Ned. &ldquo;Probably it was
Riggs, the janitor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, he was too tall for Riggs,&rdquo; answered Bart.
&ldquo;Besides, he didn&rsquo;t limp, as Riggs does, from a leg
that was once broken. No, this man wasn&rsquo;t Riggs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What was he doing?&rdquo; asked Frank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Standing near the front door, as if he was going
in. Then he seemed to change his mind. I think&mdash;There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
he is again!&rdquo; exclaimed Bart, suddenly, and
he shrank farther back into the dense shadows, his
chums following his example.</p>

<p>At the same instant Ned and Frank caught sight
of the man. The stranger approached the front
door as if afraid of being seen, and, every now and
then, he turned about, as the boys could notice to
take an observation. As they looked on they saw
him suddenly open the front door, after fumbling
about the lock, and enter the school, closing the
portal behind him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, what do you think of that?&rdquo; gasped Bart,
after a moment&rsquo;s pause.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a burglar!&rdquo; declared Frank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go tell the police,&rdquo; suggested Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, wait a minute,&rdquo; advised Bart, putting restraining
hands on his two chums. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell the
police.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; Ned wanted to know.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because they might ask what we were doing
around the school at night, and we don&rsquo;t want to
tell&mdash;do we?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; agreed Frank. &ldquo;Maybe that chap
isn&rsquo;t a burglar, after all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; came from Ned. &ldquo;What could
a burglar steal in the school?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Books, and instruments from the laboratory,&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
was Bart&rsquo;s contribution to the opinions. &ldquo;But I,
myself, don&rsquo;t believe he is a burglar. Possibly he is
some one whom Riggs hired to help out with the
sweeping and dusting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s wait and see,&rdquo; suggested Frank, and this
was agreed to. Silently the chums, from their
place of hiding, kept their eyes on the school. Presently
there was a flicker of light in the windows of
one of the upper rooms.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; exclaimed Ned, &ldquo;what did I tell you!
He&rsquo;s a new janitor, sweeping out,&rdquo; for the light
moved to and fro.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What room is that?&rdquo; asked Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Professor Long&rsquo;s&mdash;the place where we&rsquo;re bound
for,&rdquo; answered Frank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hush! Not so loud,&rdquo; pleaded Bart. &ldquo;Some one
may hear you, and get on to our trick. I guess
you&rsquo;re right. We&rsquo;ll wait until he gets out of the
way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It may be a long time, and Fenn may come
looking for us,&rdquo; ventured Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t help it,&rdquo; decided Bart. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t go
in while the man is there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There seemed no way out of it, and the three
chums crouched in the shadows, waiting. It was
cold, and more than once they wished they had not
started to play the joke on Fenn, but they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
not going to give up now. They saw the light,
moving to and fro, but it did not leave the room
where they had first observed it&mdash;the classroom of
Professor Long, the science teacher.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He must be giving that a good cleaning,&rdquo; remarked
Bart. Hardly had he spoken than the light
disappeared. A few minutes later it was visible
on the floor below, and then it could be traced, as
the person carrying it, descended.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s coming out,&rdquo; declared Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So much the better,&rdquo; commented Frank.</p>

<p>An instant later the front door opened and
the man who had gone in, hurried out. He seemed
in great haste for, giving a quick look around, he
darted away from the school, down the front walk,
and up the street.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fellows, that was no janitor!&rdquo; declared Bart.
&ldquo;I believe he was a burglar!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But he didn&rsquo;t have any bundles,&rdquo; declared
Frank. &ldquo;If he had stolen anything, he&rsquo;d have to
pack it up, as anything of value in the school is quite
bulky. I don&rsquo;t believe he took anything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then why did he run?&rdquo; demanded Bart.</p>

<p>This was a poser for his chums, until Frank said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;It may have been one of the teachers who went
back after some papers he forgot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t look like any of the teachers,&rdquo; said Bart.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
&ldquo;Besides the teachers wouldn&rsquo;t run, as if the police
were after them, and they wouldn&rsquo;t act as frightened
as that man did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, what are we going to do about it?&rdquo; asked
Ned. &ldquo;If we&rsquo;re going to play that joke, let&rsquo;s get
busy. We won&rsquo;t say anything about seeing the
man unless something developes, and I don&rsquo;t believe
it will. Come on in. The front door seems to be
open. We can go in that way, instead of around
through the court; less chance of Riggs seeing us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; agreed Bart, &ldquo;only I wish I knew
who that man was.&rdquo; The time was to come when
the boys would have given a great deal to have been
able to penetrate the identity of the mysterious
stranger. But the three chums gave little heed to
that now, for they were intent on playing a joke
that Bart had evolved. A little later, finding the
front door unlocked, they were inside the school,
just as the distant town clock boomed out the hour
of midnight.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>

<h3>THE MISSING DIAMOND BRACELET</h3>


<p>There were three lads who had entered the
Darewell High School so mysteriously at midnight,
and, had any one seen them, who was acquainted
with them, he would have at once asked:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is the fourth member of the quartette?
Where is Stumpy Masterson?&rdquo; For there were
four lads in the town of Darewell who were so inseparable
that they had come to be known as &ldquo;The
Darewell Chums.&rdquo; Their names you are already
familiar with, and some of my readers have met
them before in the previous books of this series.</p>

<p>In the first volume, entitled, &ldquo;The Heroes of the
School,&rdquo; there was related how the four friends took
part in a strange mystery, and how they got at
the bottom of it. At one time they went up in
a balloon, and were captured by some men who were
their enemies, so that, for a time, it looked dubious
for the lads. But our heroes were wide-awake,
and resourceful, and managed to take care of
themselves.</p>

<p>Their home, as I have said, was in the town of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
Darewell, which was located on the Still River, a
stream that flowed into Lake Erie. Living not far
from that great body of water, the four chums often
made trips to it, though more frequently they went
swimming in or sailing on the river, in summer, and
skated on it in winter.</p>

<p>In the second volume of the series, called &ldquo;Ned
Wilding&rsquo;s Disappearance,&rdquo; a story was told of how
Ned tried to become a millionaire on his own account.
He speculated in stocks, and to do this he
had to go to New York. There he became mixed
up in some peculiar transactions, and he thought it
was necessary for him to disappear to avoid arrest.
His chums, who followed him to the city, tried for
some time in vain to find him, and poor Ned suffered
many hardships before the affair was finally
straightened out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Frank Roscoe&rsquo;s Secret&rdquo; was the title of the third
volume. There always seemed to be a mystery about
Frank Roscoe, and his chums could never penetrate
it. At times he was moody and distraught, and he
seemed to have some secret that worried him. He
made no confidant of any one and succeeded in
avoiding all inquiries.</p>

<p>The four lads went camping, and it was hoped
that Frank would forget his troubles, but, instead,
he seemed to get right into the thick of them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
Frank, for some years, had believed his father dead,
but it transpired that he was not. Mr. Roscoe was
kept in a private insane asylum, though he had full
possession of his reason, only he was made ill by
drugs constantly administered to him by men who
had an interest in keeping him out of the way.
How he was rescued, and the perils the boys ran in
saving him after they had released him from the
institution, you will find set down in the third book.</p>

<p>In the fourth book, called &ldquo;Fenn Masterson&rsquo;s
Discovery,&rdquo; there was related the details of a
long trip the chums took on the Great Lakes.
They were aboard a vessel commanded by Captain
Wiggs, and almost from the start the boys
were involved in a mystery. They were pursued
by strange men, when they landed to witness a
large grain elevator on fire, and eventually they
succeeded in causing the breaking up of a gang
of Chinese smugglers, and a band of scoundrels who
were secretly taking valuable minerals from a cave,
under land owned by a man whom the boys had once
befriended. It was not until after some strenuous
happenings that these events had come to pass, and,
more than once, our friends were in danger. But
Fenn Masterson succeeded in getting on the trail
of the mystery, through an odd discovery he had
made, and, though he was captured by the enemy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
he used his eyes and ears to good advantage, so that
when his friends came he could lead them to the
secret cave.</p>

<p>Following the exciting events of their cruise on
the Great Lakes, the boys had returned to Darewell,
and had resumed their studies at the High
School, where they were great favorites with the
other pupils. At the time this story opens the fall
term was well under way, and football was the
chief sport, our heroes playing on the first team of
the school.</p>

<p>The reason for the midnight visit of Bart, Frank
and Ned to the school was this: Stumpy, the missing
member of the quartette, was an odd sort of lad,
always making collections of one thing or another.
Sometimes it was postage stamps, or postmarks, and
again minerals, or jackknives, or butterflies.</p>

<p>The day of the midnight visit, when the Darewell
Chums, together with Bart&rsquo;s sister Alice (who wanted
to be a trained nurse) and her chum, Jennie
Smith, were in a drug store getting soda and cream,
Fenn had pulled from his pocket, together with his
handkerchief, a small mud turtle. There had been
a wild scramble on the part of the girls, and some
ladies in the store, before Fenn recaptured the reptile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that for?&rdquo; Bart had asked.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, nothing,&rdquo; Fenn had answered, as casually
as possible.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It certainly <i>is</i> something,&rdquo; Ned had insisted,
and they had badgered Fenn until he finally admitted
that he was now collecting mud turtles, and
had a number of them in a pen at home.</p>

<p>This had at once given Bart his cue for playing a
joke, and it might be mentioned that the fun-loving
youth never let go by a chance to play a trick. A
little later, that same afternoon, after Fenn had
been sufficiently &ldquo;rigged&rdquo; over his new fad, Bart
Keene might have been seen whispering cautiously
to Ned and Frank.</p>

<p>His proposal was that the three of them should
pay a surreptitious visit to the school that Friday
night, and, from the room of Professor Long, the
science teacher, take a number of turtles, snakes
and small alligators which the instructor kept for
the use of his class in biology. The three conspirators
planned to remove the reptiles, take them to
Fenn&rsquo;s house, slyly put them in with his collection
of turtles, and then see what their chum would say
when he found his number of reptiles so unexpectedly
increased.</p>

<p>The plan found favor on the part of Ned and
Frank. They had met at Bart&rsquo;s home after supper,
and started off, leaving word with Alice, that if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
Fenn accidentally came, he was to be detained, entertained,
or something done to him, to prevent him
from becoming suspicious over the absence of the
three lads.</p>

<p>But Fenn, or Stumpy, which he was more frequently
called, had no suspicions, and did not leave
his house that night. Meanwhile, as told in the
first chapter, Bart and the others had gone to the
school, had suffered a momentary alarm at the sight
of the mysterious man, and had finally gained an
entrance through the front door, unexpectedly
found open.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;re in here, what&rsquo;s next on the program?&rdquo;
asked Ned, of Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go ahead up stairs, and don&rsquo;t make any more
noise than you have to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Long familiarity with the interior arrangements
of the High School enabled the three lads to ascend
the stairs without the aid of a light. Bart, as a
precaution, however, had brought along a pocket
electric flash lamp, to use when they reached the
case of live reptiles.</p>

<p>They got to the room where Professor Long gave
instruction, and when Bart sent out little flashes of
light, all gazed quickly around.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No traces of any burglar here,&rdquo; observed Frank.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Guess you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; admitted Bart. &ldquo;But we
surely saw some one up here with a light.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Might have been one of Riggs&rsquo; friends,&rdquo; commented
Ned. &ldquo;Anyhow he isn&rsquo;t here now. Come
on, and let&rsquo;s finish. It&rsquo;s getting late. The cabinet
of turtles, alligators and snakes is over here,&rdquo; and
he led the way across the almost dark room, for the
electric lamp only gave light in a small circle.</p>

<p>Professor Long was more enthusiastic over
science than are most teachers, and he used live animals
to illustrate points in biology, evolution and
kindred studies. Hence he had quite a collection
of reptiles, which were kept in a case especially constructed
for them, where they could be fed and
watched, and live under conditions as nearly approaching
those of nature as possible.</p>

<p>The three conspirators proposed &ldquo;borrowing&rdquo; a
few specimens, smuggling them into Stumpy&rsquo;s collection,
which was kept in a shack in his back yard,
and, after witnessing his surprise, they would take
Professor Long&rsquo;s reptiles back to the school. The
interval between the closing of the school Friday
night and the Monday morning opening gave them
time for this.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Get some of the toads, lizards, alligators and
snakes, besides the mud turtles,&rdquo; advised Bart, &ldquo;and
take care that the beggars don&rsquo;t bite you. I don&rsquo;t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
want to get blood poison, even if my sister is studying
to be a trained nurse. Here, I&rsquo;ll hold the light,
and you fellows can put the creatures in the bags.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, you will!&rdquo; exclaimed Frank, somewhat indignantly.
&ldquo;You want us to run all the risks! No,
sir, you put the lamp down and pitch in yourself.
If we get bit, so do you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But the lamp won&rsquo;t give any light unless I press
the spring,&rdquo; explained Bart, for the electric switch
was thus operated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show you how to make it,&rdquo; volunteered Ned.
&ldquo;I can fasten the spring with a match,&rdquo; which he
proceeded to do, the light glowing without any one
touching the spring. Bart had no further excuse,
and assisted his chums in transferring to the bags
he had brought a large part of Professor Long&rsquo;s collection.
The reptiles made little resistance, though
one of the large turtles did nip Frank slightly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind, Alice will put on some carbolic
salve or peroxide,&rdquo; said Bart, cheerfully. &ldquo;I guess
we&rsquo;ve got enough now. Look out, there&rsquo;s a snake
going to get away!&rdquo; He grabbed the lively reptile
just in time, and stuffed it into his bag.</p>

<p>The three conspirators hurried away from the
school, and made their way to the back yard of
Fenn&rsquo;s house. The shack was fastened with a
simple catch, which Bart had no difficulty in loosening.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
Then, working quickly and silently, the three
chums made a large addition to Fenn&rsquo;s collection.
The snakes, turtles, lizards and frogs from the
school cabinet were put in the boxes with Fenn&rsquo;s
pets, and the small doors fastened. Then the hut
was closed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now we must be on hand here early to-morrow
morning,&rdquo; said Bart, as they sneaked away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure. We&rsquo;ll pretend to Fenn that we are anxious
to see his collection,&rdquo; said Ned. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be only
too glad to take us out here, and then we can see
his expression, when he catches sight of the visitors.
Oh, we&rsquo;ll be on hand all right!&rdquo; and then the trio
went to their homes.</p>

<p>Early the next morning, Bart, Ned and Frank
called on Fenn. He had not been in evidence the
night before, so they felt sure their trick had not
been discovered. He came to the door in response
to their whistles.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, you fellows are on the job early, aren&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo; inquired Stumpy, with just a shade of suspicion
in his tones.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We want to have a little football practice,&rdquo; answered
Bart. &ldquo;And we came to see if you&rsquo;d show
us your collection of turtles.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hey? What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; asked Fenn, quickly.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s straight, Stumpy,&rdquo; added Ned. &ldquo;We
won&rsquo;t hurt &rsquo;em, will we, fellows?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure not,&rdquo; agreed Frank.</p>

<p>His suspicions lulled to rest, Fenn led the way to
the shack in the back yard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t fed &rsquo;em yet,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;I was
just going to when you chaps came along. I haven&rsquo;t
had my breakfast yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s awful to have to pay these social calls
on young ladies!&rdquo; mocked Bart, pretending to yawn.
&ldquo;It keeps you up so late, and morning comes too
soon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aw, cut it out,&rdquo; advised Fenn, with an injured
air, but he blushed. &ldquo;Now, no poking the turtles,&rdquo;
he stipulated, as he opened the shack door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Visitors are politely requested not to feed or
annoy the animals,&rdquo; quoted Bart, from some menagerie
sign. &ldquo;Do they eat much?&rdquo; he asked of
Fenn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, not much, especially in cool weather.
They&rsquo;re sort of sluggish then. I haven&rsquo;t got many
yet, but I expect to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>By this time Fenn had the door open, and the
sight that met his eyes almost bereft him of speech.</p>

<p>For, to his small collection had been added nearly
all the reptiles from the High School. Snakes
reared up their heads and hissed at him. From the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
corner of one cage a large mud turtle stuck out its
leathery neck. A fat toad, one of many, squatted on
the box of worms Fenn kept for his &ldquo;pets,&rdquo; and
two alligators, like twins, waved their long tails to
and fro.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For the love of Mike, what have you here?&rdquo;
cried Bart, pretending to be frightened.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good land! You never said you had so many!&rdquo;
added Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it safe to go in? Let me hide behind you,
Stumpy. You&rsquo;re so fat and juicy that they&rsquo;d grab
you first,&rdquo; said Frank.</p>

<p>For a moment Fenn did not speak. Then he
understood the joke that had been played.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You fellows think you&rsquo;re awful smart; don&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo; he demanded. &ldquo;Well, all I&rsquo;ve got to say
is&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That you&rsquo;re stung! Eh, Stumpy, my lad?&rdquo; cried
Bart good naturedly, clapping his chum on the back.
&ldquo;Take your medicine like a man. You&rsquo;re stung
good and proper. We thought your animals would
be lonesome, so we added a few for luck. Pretty,
aren&rsquo;t they?&rdquo; and, at the sight of Fenn&rsquo;s bewildered
face, Bart went off in a paroxysm of mirth, finally
lying down on the ground outside the shack, and
rolling over and over.</p>

<p>Frank and Ned joined him, and their howls<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
brought Mrs. Masterson to the back door to see
what was the matter. As soon as she saw the four
chums she knew, without being told, that it was
some joke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t be them, if they weren&rsquo;t up to something,&rdquo;
she observed, as she went on getting breakfast.</p>

<p>Fenn was not long proof against the infectious
laughter of his chums. The frown faded from his
face, and a smile replaced it. Soon, he too, was
laughing heartily at the joke played on him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All I&rsquo;ve got to say,&rdquo; he remarked, &ldquo;is that you
fellows went to a lot of work to get a laugh. You
must have brought nearly all the school collection,&rdquo;
for he recognized the professor&rsquo;s specimens.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We did,&rdquo; admitted Bart, &ldquo;but it was worth it
all; eh, fellows?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boys paused to admire Fenn&rsquo;s &ldquo;pets&rdquo; as well
as to take a more careful view of the reptiles they
had &ldquo;borrowed&rdquo; from the school. Then Bart and
his two chums put back into the bags the snakes,
lizards, turtles, toads and alligators belonging to
the professor, and hurried back with them to the
school. They were lucky in escaping observation
by the janitor, and soon the science-cabinet cages
held their former tenants.</p>

<p>There was a football game that afternoon, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
which the four chums took part, playing hard and
well, their team winning the contest by a narrow
margin. They took a short walk, Sunday, discussing
the game, and talking rather vaguely of the
possibility of going to a winter camp that year.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think it would be just the cheese, fellows,&rdquo; observed
Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would, and the crackers, too,&rdquo; conceded Ned.
&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t see how we can manage it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe we can,&rdquo; declared Frank indefinitely.</p>

<p>When the four chums went to school the following
Monday morning they were made aware that
something unusual had taken place. It was not so
much in what was said, as in an indefinable air of
expectancy on the part of several members of the
faculty. After the usual opening morning services,
Principal McCloud advanced to the edge of the platform
in the assembly hall, and remarked:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Young gentlemen, I have something to say to
you. After I have finished, Mr. Long, the science
teacher, has a few words to add.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At once Bart cast apprehensive looks at his chums.
Had the &ldquo;borrowing&rdquo; of the specimens been discovered?
It looked so.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some time between Friday night and this morning,&rdquo;
went on the principal, &ldquo;this school was entered,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
and some objects were taken from the science
cabinets.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was no doubt about it. The blow had fallen.
Bart, Ned and Frank prepared to &ldquo;take their medicine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It has been discovered,&rdquo; continued Mr. McCloud,
&ldquo;that several specimens of snakes, lizards,
toads and alligators were surreptitiously removed
from Professor Long&rsquo;s cabinet. This would not have
been so serious, for, whoever took them, brought
them all back again&mdash;that is all save one. I regret
to report that one of the finest and largest specimens
of mud turtles is missing. Now Professor Long
has a word to say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Long, who was a small man, with a bustling,
nervous manner, came briskly to the edge of the
platform.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can only confirm what Professor McCloud has
said,&rdquo; he began. &ldquo;While I regret exceedingly that
any persons, least of all pupils of this school, whom
I may say we suspect, could so far forget themselves
as to run the risk of damaging my collection
of reptiles, that is not the worst I have to speak
about. The loss of the mud turtle is serious, for it
was a rare kind, but there is something else missing.
It is a valuable diamond bracelet, belonging to my
wife. She gave it to me, as she was going away on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
a little trip, to take to the jewelers to have the setting
of some of the stones tightened, and I placed it in
the cabinet with the reptiles for safe keeping, until
school should be closed, Friday. I forgot all about
it until this morning, and when I went to look for
it, I discovered that my collection had been disturbed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was easy to see,&rdquo; went on Mr. Long, &ldquo;that
some one had taken the reptiles out, and placed
them back, for they were not in their proper cages.
It was also easy to see that my wife&rsquo;s diamond bracelet
was missing. It is valued at over a thousand
dollars, and I presume was taken by accident, or,
perhaps, for a joke. In either case I shall be glad to
have it back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I might add that I have certain clews as to
who were the midnight visitors to the school, for one
of them dropped his knife, and it has his name on
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bart frantically felt in his pocket, and then, conscious
that many eyes were on him, sat still, but a
guilty flush suffused his face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If the bracelet is returned to me,&rdquo; went on Mr.
Long, &ldquo;all will be well. If not, I must take&mdash;&rdquo; he
hesitated a moment&mdash;&ldquo;strenuous measures,&rdquo; he added.
&ldquo;I will await in the principal&rsquo;s office, any one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
who may wish to see me,&rdquo; he concluded significantly,
after a pause.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are dismissed to your classes,&rdquo; said Principal
McCloud. &ldquo;Any one who wishes to see Professor
Long has permission to do so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boys arose, and filed from the assembly hall;
the girls were on the floor below. Bart looked at
Frank and Ned. Then Fenn whispered:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe the missing turtle is in with mine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; Bart whispered back. &ldquo;But what of
the diamond bracelet? We never took it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The man&mdash;the stranger&mdash;who was in the school
just before us?&rdquo; replied Ned. &ldquo;Fellows, I guess
we&rsquo;d better make a clean breast of it to Mr. Long!&rdquo;</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>

<h3>A FRUITLESS SEARCH</h3>


<p>There was much buzzing and whispering among
the pupils as they marched to their classrooms&mdash;whispering
which the teachers and principal thought
best to ignore under the circumstances, for the
morning announcement had been an unusual one.</p>

<p>Bart, Fenn, Ned and Frank were in the same
grade, and their first morning period was taken up
with a Latin recitation. All four were doing some
hard thinking as they got out their books in Mr.
Kenton&rsquo;s room. Bart Keene was the first of the four
chums to make up his mind. He felt a certain responsibility,
since he had proposed the joke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Kenton,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;may I be excused for
a moment?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What for, Keene?&rdquo; inquired the Latin instructor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish to&mdash;to speak to Professor Long.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was an audible gasp of astonishment from
Bart&rsquo;s classmates at this. Ned and Frank started
to their feet, to utter a protest. They saw Bart&rsquo;s
motive, but they were not going to let him bear the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
brunt of the punishment alone. There was a curious
look on the face of Fenn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You may go, Keene,&rdquo; went on the instructor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;May I also?&rdquo; exclaimed Frank, and again there
was a buzz of excited whispers. The other lads
knew what Bart&rsquo;s request meant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Silence!&rdquo; called Mr. Kenton, sharply. &ldquo;One at
a time is enough,&rdquo; he added grimly. &ldquo;We will proceed
with the lesson. Ned Wilding, you may begin
to translate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Discipline held sway once more, and the boys
settled back into their seats. Bart, conscious that
the eyes of every lad in the room were on him,
walked out. He found Professor Long in the chemical
laboratory, preparing for some class work.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, Keene,&rdquo; remarked the science instructor,
as he mixed some unpleasant-smelling liquids in a
test tube. &ldquo;Did you wish to see me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;yes, sir,&rdquo; stammered Bart. &ldquo;You said&mdash;that
is&mdash;I&mdash;er&mdash;I was the one who took the collection
of reptiles,&rdquo; blurted out the uneasy lad. &ldquo;But
I didn&rsquo;t take the diamond bracelet! We didn&rsquo;t see
anything of it! I hope you&rsquo;ll believe me! You
don&rsquo;t know how unpleasant it is to be accused. At
one time I&mdash;that is my chums and I&mdash;were accused
of blowing up the school tower with dynamite,
and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I remember that happening,&rdquo; went on Mr.
Long, gravely. &ldquo;You were innocent on that occasion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And we are innocent now!&rdquo; burst out Bart.
&ldquo;We&mdash;that is I&mdash;took the turtles and the alligators,
but we&mdash;that is I&mdash;never saw the bracelet. Are you
sure it was in the cabinet, Mr. Long?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very sure, Bart. But you might save yourself some
embarrassment by telling me all the details. I&rsquo;m
glad to see you willing to bear all the blame, but,
if you were alone in the escapade, how is it that I
found Ned Wilding&rsquo;s knife, and this handkerchief
with Frank Roscoe&rsquo;s name on it,&rdquo; and the instructor,
with a smile, held up the articles he mentioned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I dropped Ned&rsquo;s knife,&rdquo; replied Bart. &ldquo;I
had borrowed it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And Frank&rsquo;s handkerchief?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t have that,&rdquo; and Bart looked confused.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I can guess how it was,&rdquo; said Mr. Long
at length. &ldquo;You were all four after my collection,
and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not all four!&rdquo; interrupted Bart. &ldquo;Fenn wasn&rsquo;t
there. You see we were playing a joke on him,&rdquo; the
lad went on, in a burst of confidence, realizing that
it was useless to try to shoulder all the blame.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
&ldquo;Ned, Frank and I came in here Friday night and
got the things. I knew I had lost Ned&rsquo;s knife, but
I didn&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d dropped it here. But Fenn wasn&rsquo;t
along. We took the things to his house, and put
them in the pen with his reptiles. He is making a
collection.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So I understand,&rdquo; remarked Mr. Long. &ldquo;Therefor
I have a proposal to make. It is barely possible
that in gathering up the toads, alligators and turtles
from my cabinet that you boys picked up the bracelet
with them. You may have dropped it in the
place where Fenn keeps his collection. Perhaps if
you go there and look you will find it, and also
the missing turtle, which I value highly. But, of
course, the bracelet is more valuable, and as it was
a birthday present to Mrs. Long she will feel the
loss very much. Will you kindly go and look? I
am sure Mr. McCloud will excuse you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be glad to make a search!&rdquo; exclaimed Bart,
eagerly. &ldquo;Perhaps if Ned and Frank&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just what I was about to propose,&rdquo; interrupted
the instructor. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll request the principal to let you
four boys leave your classes this morning, to make
a hunt for the missing bracelet&mdash;and the turtle.
Don&rsquo;t forget that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m&mdash;I&rsquo;m very sorry&mdash;sorry we disturbed your
collection, Professor Long,&rdquo; stammered Bart, &ldquo;but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
I know we never touched, or saw, the diamond
bracelet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know you didn&rsquo;t mean to take the bracelet,&rdquo;
went on Mr. Long, a bit stiffly. &ldquo;Of course it was
a foolish, and, at the same time, a risky trick to play,
and, while I believe you had no intention of keeping
the bracelet, I cannot but believe that in some way
you removed it from the cabinet, either in catching
up one of the reptiles hurriedly, or otherwise. I
shall be glad to talk with Ned and Frank. But now
I suggest that you go to Fenn&rsquo;s house and make a
search.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We never took or saw the bracelet, Professor!&rdquo;
declared Bart, with great earnestness. He felt,
somehow, just as he did the time the unjust accusation
of blowing up the school tower was made
against him and his chums, as related in a former
volume of this series.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; remarked the teacher, &ldquo;I can only say
that you boys were the only ones in the school
after the closing hours Friday. Some time between
then and this morning, the reptiles were taken and
returned&mdash;that is all but one large turtle&mdash;and the
diamond bracelet belonging to my wife. There can
be but one conclusion, and I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We were not the only ones in the school between
Friday night and this morning!&rdquo; exclaimed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
Bart, and instantly his thoughts reverted to the
stranger who had acted so mysteriously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; asked the instructor,
quickly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I mean&mdash;the janitor,&rdquo; replied Bart, with a sudden
change in his tone. He had started to mention
the man, but concluded not to. He had several
reasons for this, as will develop presently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is where you are mistaken,&rdquo; declared Professor
Long. &ldquo;The janitor, and two assistants
whom he hired, cleaned out the school late Friday
afternoon. I know, for I remained here to go over
some of my class records. It was late when I left,
and the janitor had finished before I was ready to
go. I know this because Riggs asked me to be sure
and close the front door and put the spring lock on
when I came out. I was the last person to leave
the school Friday night, and I locked the door.
Riggs had gone. The reason why he did his cleaning
work Friday night, and not Saturday, as is
usual, was because he wanted to go away over Sunday.
He did go, I understand, so you see you boys
were the only ones in the school.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And did you lock the front door after you?&rdquo;
asked Bart with a sudden suspicion in his mind, as
he thought of the mysterious man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did, certainly. Why do you ask?&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;nothing&mdash;only I thought&mdash;I&mdash;&rdquo; Again
Bart was about to speak of the midnight visitor to
the school, and again he refrained.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By the way, how did you boys get in the
school?&rdquo; asked Professor Long, suddenly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;er&mdash;we&mdash;that is&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; hastily interrupted the instructor,
&ldquo;I should not have asked that. I have no wish to
pry further into this matter than is necessary. Believe
me, I appreciate your motive in making a clean
breast of it. I do not care to know all the details.
Boys will be boys, I suppose. Only get me back the
diamond bracelet and the turtle. I will see Mr. McCloud
at once, and I&rsquo;m sure he will let you make
a search at Fenn&rsquo;s house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bart&rsquo;s opportunity had passed. If he only had
mentioned the fact that he and his chums found
the front door open, and had seen a mysterious man
enter the school, things might have turned out
differently, and much trouble have been averted.
But now it was too late. Mr. Long hurried to the
office of the principal, and returned shortly with
permission for the four chums to go and make a
search.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But why didn&rsquo;t you tell him about the man we
saw?&rdquo; asked Ned, as they were on their way to
Fenn&rsquo;s house.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; answered Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a regular girl&rsquo;s reason,&rdquo; objected Frank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; answered Bart desperately, somewhat
weary and nervous over the ordeal through which
he had gone, &ldquo;the chief reason was that if I told
that, I&rsquo;d have to tell why we didn&rsquo;t notify the police.
That&rsquo;s where we made a mistake. If that fellow
was a thief, and took the bracelet, we should have
called the police.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t know he was a thief&mdash;we don&rsquo;t know
it yet,&rdquo; declared Frank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, but when we saw a stranger sneaking into
the school, we should have had gumption enough to
notify the authorities,&rdquo; insisted Bart. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
where we were slow. I didn&rsquo;t want to make it any
worse. If we find the bracelet, all right; we won&rsquo;t
have to tell how silly we were.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And if we don&rsquo;t find it&mdash;which is very likely to
be the case&mdash;what then?&rdquo; asked Fenn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, we didn&rsquo;t take it, that&rsquo;s certain,&rdquo; decided
Frank. &ldquo;Neither by accident nor intentionally&mdash;did
we take that bracelet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then the man we saw, did,&rdquo; said Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and he&rsquo;s far enough off by now,&rdquo; observed
Frank. &ldquo;Fellows, I&rsquo;ll bet he was the thief!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How could he be?&rdquo; asked Bart. &ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t
know the bracelet was in the cabinet. Besides, no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
ordinary person would think of looking among a lot
of reptiles for anything valuable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, if we don&rsquo;t find it I think we&rsquo;d better tell
about the man,&rdquo; was Fenn&rsquo;s opinion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It will be too late then,&rdquo; insisted Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Too late? Why?&rdquo; Frank wanted to know.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because if we come back without the missing
turtle and bracelet, and tell about having seen a
mysterious man enter the school just before we did,
on Friday night, every one will say we made up the
story to shield ourselves. No, the best way, if we
can&rsquo;t find that diamond ornament, is to keep mum
about the man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And let them accuse us?&rdquo; cried Frank, indignantly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For a while&mdash;yes,&rdquo; replied Bart. &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t be
the first time, and probably not the last. But I don&rsquo;t
mean by that for us to sit still under the accusation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What <i>do</i> you mean?&rdquo; asked Fenn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I mean to find the missing bracelet, Stumpy!&rdquo;
was the emphatic answer. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ve got
to do! It&rsquo;s up to us! We didn&rsquo;t take it, but perhaps
that man did. If so we&rsquo;ve got to find him as well
as the bracelet. Come on, now, not so much talking.
Let&rsquo;s get busy, but, remember, if we don&rsquo;t find the
bracelet now, we must keep mum about the man, if
we don&rsquo;t want to be laughed at, as well as accused.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>There was a momentary discussion, but Bart&rsquo;s
chums agreed with him, as they usually did. They
hastened on to Fenn&rsquo;s house, and at once began a
frantic search about the yard and in the shack
where the lad kept his reptiles.</p>

<p>But there was no sign of the bracelet. Fenn
lifted out every one of his turtles, toads and kindred
specimens, and the place was gone over carefully.
So was the route the boys had taken to and from
the school. But it was a fruitless search.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fellows, let&rsquo;s look for the mud turtle, anyhow,&rdquo;
suggested Ned. &ldquo;Maybe we can find that for Professor
Long, if we can&rsquo;t get the bracelet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They looked in every likely and unlikely place for
the missing turtle, but it had vanished as completely
as had the bracelet. They were loath to give up the
hunt, but concluded that there was nothing else to
do. As they were about to return to the school
much cast down and dispirited, to report no progress,
Fenn exclaimed:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fellows, I have just thought of something.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Out with it,&rdquo; ordered Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe the mud turtle has the bracelet!&rdquo; exclaimed
the stout youth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The mud turtle? Are you crazy?&rdquo; demanded
Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not,&rdquo; answered Fenn, with a show of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
indignation. &ldquo;Listen! The missing mud turtle was a
large one, and a species that has a very long neck.
Now it would be the easiest thing in the world for
the turtle to get the diamond bracelet over his neck,
and walk off with it. One of mine once got his neck
in an iron ring, and I didn&rsquo;t know it for quite a
while, as the folds of skin on the reptile&rsquo;s neck hid
the iron. I&rsquo;ll wager that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s happened in this
case. We&rsquo;ll find that the turtle is wearing Mrs.
Long&rsquo;s diamond bracelet on its neck!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; exclaimed Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, there might be something in it,&rdquo; admitted
Ned. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s have another look for that turtle,
fellows.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll look for the turtle all right,&rdquo; agreed Bart,
&ldquo;but as for expecting to find Mrs. Long&rsquo;s diamond
bracelet on its neck&mdash;why you fellows are crazy to
think of such a thing. You might as well expect to
find hickory nuts growing on a peach tree. You&rsquo;re
loony! Off your trolley! You&rsquo;ve got bats in your
belfry, as the poet says,&rdquo; and, when Frank and Ned
thought it over, they were inclined to agree with
their chum.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<h3>IN THE SHOOTING GALLERY</h3>


<p>Fenn&rsquo;s suggestion gave a new impetus to the
hunt, which was renewed with energy. Mrs. Masterson,
who heard from the boys what had taken
place, joined them in searching through the long
grass of the back yard for the turtle. But it was
not to be found.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very likely a good distance from here,&rdquo; said
Fenn, who was well versed in the habits of the reptiles.
&ldquo;They go slow, but they keep it up, and this
one has had two days&rsquo; start. We&rsquo;ll have to hunt
farther off than this for him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ll do!&rdquo; declared Frank.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll organize ourselves into a hunting party for
a diamond-studded turtle,&rdquo; and he laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no laughing matter, though,&rdquo; declared Bart.
&ldquo;If we go back and tell that kind of a yarn we&rsquo;ll
look ridiculous.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then why tell it?&rdquo; inquired Ned. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s keep
mum about that part of it, too. We&rsquo;ll simply report
to Professor Long that we can&rsquo;t find his wife&rsquo;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
bracelet, or the turtle, either, but every spare minute
we get we&rsquo;ll be on the lookout for the reptile.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the man, too,&rdquo; added Fenn. &ldquo;We want to
find out who he was.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; agreed Bart. &ldquo;We should have
given the alarm when we saw him going in the
school, but it&rsquo;s too late now. Come on back, and
take our medicine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was not a very happy quartette of lads who
made their way back to the Darewell High School.
They went directly to Professor Long, who turned
his physics class over to another instructor, and conducted
the chums to his private room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; he asked suggestively.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We couldn&rsquo;t find the bracelet or the turtle,&rdquo; said
Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was afraid not,&rdquo; was Mr. Long&rsquo;s quiet comment.
&ldquo;I have notified the detectives.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&mdash;you&rsquo;re not going to have us arrested&mdash;are
you?&rdquo; blurted out Frank. &ldquo;My father&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have no fears on that score,&rdquo; answered the professor.
&ldquo;I have not the slightest grounds for thinking
you boys <i>stole</i> the bracelet,&rdquo; and, perhaps unconsciously,
he emphasized the word.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We never took the bracelet!&rdquo; declared Ned
stoutly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of that I am not so sure,&rdquo; was the retort. &ldquo;I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
do not accuse you&mdash;that would not be right. You
have accused yourselves, after a fashion. What I
think is this: I believe the bracelet was accidentally
taken out of the cabinet in the confusion, and,
perhaps, dropped on the way to Fenn&rsquo;s house. That
is why I am sending for the police. Some person
may have picked it up, and may be keeping it. I
believe that is all now. You may return to your
classes,&rdquo; and though he tried to speak calmly, there
was a note of disappointment, not to say displeasure,
in Mr. Long&rsquo;s voice.</p>

<p>Naturally the story was all over the school by
the noon recess, and Bart and his chums were besieged
with questions. They had held a brief consultation,
and resolved to make only certain statements.
These were to the effect that though they
had played the trick with the reptiles, they knew
nothing of the bracelet, and their search for that
and the turtle, had been without avail.</p>

<p>Needless to say, that few, if any, of the students
had the least suspicion against the chums. Nor, for
that matter, did any of the faculty entertain any unjust
thoughts. It was regarded more as an accident.
Mr. Long being the party who suffered, could, perhaps,
be excused for thinking that perhaps the boys
had taken the bracelet in a joke, and were now
afraid to return it. In fact he hardly knew what to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
believe. In due time the police came to the school,
made an investigation and questioned our heroes.
They went away as wise as they came. But, as several
days passed, and there was no trace of the
bracelet, there was an undefined air of suspicion
directed against the chums. It was not in so many
words, but nevertheless they felt it.</p>

<p>Two weeks passed, during which, in all of their
spare time, Bart and his chums made a search for
the turtle in such places as the reptiles were wont
to be found. But, of course, they discovered none
wearing a diamond bracelet on its neck, though
they did find a few specimens which Fenn added to
his collection. It was not the time of year when
turtles abounded.</p>

<p>Several football games were played, and there
seemed to be no ill spirit manifested against the four
lads, until one Saturday about three weeks after the
disappearance of the diamond ornament. Then,
during a hotly-contested game with the Fernwood
High School, one of the opposing players remarked
to Bart, after a hard scrimmage:</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not used to playing against diamond robbers,
and maybe that&rsquo;s why we can&rsquo;t break through
your line.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bart&rsquo;s answer was a blow that knocked the sneering
lad down, and resulted in Bart being ruled out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
of the game. From then on the Darewell eleven
seemed to go to pieces, and they lost the game.</p>

<p>There were many sore hearts among the students
that night, and accusing glances were cast at Bart.
His chums felt his position deeply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know it was a hasty thing to do,&rdquo; said Bart,
contritely, &ldquo;but I couldn&rsquo;t help it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>From then on there seemed to be a spirit manifested
against the four chums, and, naturally, they
resented it. The others would not desert Bart, and
when he refused to apologize to the lad he had
struck, and was permanently ruled off the eleven,
Ned, Frank and Fenn resigned. They resisted the
pleading of the manager to remain, so that the
school eleven would not be crippled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the school&rsquo;s place to stick by us, as much as
it is ours to stick by the eleven,&rdquo; declared Frank.
&ldquo;The fellows are beginning to think we took that
bracelet. We&rsquo;ll show them that we didn&rsquo;t, and, in
the meanwhile, it&rsquo;s better that we don&rsquo;t take part in
any games.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His chums agreed with him, and for a time it
seemed as if they would be sent to Coventry. But
a calmer spirit prevailed, and when some of the
school societies took up the matter it was agreed
that the four had a right to do as they pleased, and
that the lad who had made the offensive remark<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
was in the wrong; and so matters quieted down.</p>

<p>But the football season ended anything but brilliantly
for Darewell, and the four chums felt this
bitterly in their hearts, though they could do no
differently than they had done.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should think you boys would hire a detective
on your own account,&rdquo; said Alice Keene to her
brother, one November evening, when the four
chums were at Bart&rsquo;s house. &ldquo;You could get one
easily, and perhaps he could locate the bracelet for
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll do it ourselves,&rdquo; remarked Bart firmly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If we could only find the turtle we&rsquo;d have it, I&rsquo;m
sure,&rdquo; declared Fenn, who had not lost faith in his
odd theory.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve looked in every likely place where turtles
are around here,&rdquo; said Frank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; and now we ought to go farther off,&rdquo;
came from Ned. &ldquo;I say fellows, what&rsquo;s the matter
with going on a little hunting expedition soon?
The weather is just right, we all have guns, and I
think the trip would do us good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not make it a big hunting expedition while
we&rsquo;re at it?&rdquo; suggested Frank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A big one? What do you mean?&rdquo; asked Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, I mean go camping, as we did not long
ago. We don&rsquo;t mind the cold, or ice and snow. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
could make a winter camp, around the Christmas
holidays, and have lots of sport.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And a Christmas tree in the woods!&rdquo; cried Alice.
&ldquo;That would be lovely! Jennie Smith and I would
come out and see you&mdash;if it wasn&rsquo;t too far.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Jennie&rsquo;d recite poetry, and you&rsquo;d insist on
making us drink hot ginger tea, so as not to catch
cold,&rdquo; observed Bart.</p>

<p>Alice looked a little hurt, until Ned added:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m sure ginger tea would be all right in
a snow storm, such as we had the last time we
camped in the winter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; agreed Alice, gratefully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would be a good thing to get away from
school and the town of Darewell for a while, at
least,&rdquo; was Bart&rsquo;s opinion. &ldquo;People are beginning
to think we really stole that bracelet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Bart!&rdquo; remonstrated Alice, reproachfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s the truth,&rdquo; he went on doggedly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d
as soon have &rsquo;em say it as look it. I&rsquo;d like to get
away for that reason, and, of course, it would be
sport to have a winter camp again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then let&rsquo;s do it,&rdquo; proposed Ned. &ldquo;At the same
time we can look for mud turtles.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t see many, unless there&rsquo;s a thaw,&rdquo; was
Fenn&rsquo;s opinion. &ldquo;But you can count on me going.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And me,&rdquo; added Frank and Ned.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Hasn&rsquo;t anything been learned of the missing
bracelet yet?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Keene, coming into the
room, in time to hear some of the conversation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered her son, &ldquo;and it&rsquo;s my opinion
that it never will be found, until&mdash;&rdquo; He paused in
some confusion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Until when?&rdquo; asked his mother.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Until we locate it,&rdquo; finished Bart. &ldquo;Well, fellows,
let&rsquo;s talk of a winter camp. Maybe we can
manage it around the holidays. We don&rsquo;t get
much of a vacation, but I guess we could afford to
take an extra week.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is your gun in shape again, since you broke it?&rdquo;
asked Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure. I fixed that spring,&rdquo; replied Bart. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
show you. Come on up to my den. I&rsquo;m not allowed
to have firearms in the dining-room,&rdquo; and he led
the way, his chums following. From then on, until
the three left, the talk was a conglomeration of
powder, shot, shells, guns, game and camp-life.</p>

<p>The weeks passed. Little mention was made of
the bracelet now, but Mr. Long showed by his manner
that he had not forgotten the loss of it. He was
not exactly distrustful of the boys, but his bearing
was, to say the least, a bit suspicious.</p>

<p>One evening, following an examination in school,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
Bart remarked to his chums, as they gathered at
his house:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come on down to the shooting gallery. They&rsquo;ve
got some new guns there, and I want to try them.
It&rsquo;s good practice if we&rsquo;re going camping. Besides,
I&rsquo;m full of Latin verbs and Greek roots, and I
want to clear my mind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need any practice,&rdquo; remarked Ned.
&ldquo;You can beat us all to pieces shooting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have to keep in practice, though,&rdquo; asserted
Bart, who, to give him credit, was quite expert with
the rifle.</p>

<p>A little later the four were in the gallery, trying
their skill with the new rifles which the proprietor
had purchased.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s one that ought to suit you, Bart,&rdquo; remarked
the man in charge, who was well known to
the boys. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s well balanced. Try that small
target.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I want something moving, Clayton,&rdquo; replied
Bart. &ldquo;Start off the birds and beasts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>These were small images of birds and squirrels
that moved around on a sort of endless chain arrangement.
Clayton, the man in charge of the gallery,
set the machinery in motion, and the painted
effigies began to go around. Bart raised the rifle&mdash;a
repeater&mdash;to his shoulder, took quick aim, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
fired. A bird was knocked over, then a squirrel
went down, and, in rapid succession he repeated this
until he had fifteen hits to his credit, out of a possible
sixteen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fine!&rdquo; cried Ned, enviously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should have had &rsquo;em all,&rdquo; announced Bart
with a shake of his head. &ldquo;Here, some of you fellows
try.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They did, but could not do nearly as good as had
Bart. Then Bart contented himself with making
bullseyes at a stationary target, though Frank and
Ned made another effort to equal Bart&rsquo;s record with
the moving objects. Frank came the nearest with
ten.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now I&rsquo;ll try for sixteen out of sixteen,&rdquo; announced
Bart, as Clayton reloaded the weapon for
him.</p>

<p>By this time a crowd had gathered in the gallery,
which, being a new amusement resort in town, was
quite an attraction. Bart paid no attention to the
spectators grouped back of him, but, with the coolness
a veteran shot might envy, he began.</p>

<p>Report after report rang out, and at each burst
of flame and puff of smoke a bird or a squirrel
toppled over, until fifteen straight had gone down.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the stuff!&rdquo; cried one man, enthusiastically,
as Bart was about to make his last shot.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; cautioned Clayton, but Bart did not
mind. He fired his last bullet, and knocked over his
sixteenth target, only he did not hit it as squarely as
he had the others.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s very good shooting, my lad,&rdquo; remarked a
man who had stood near Bart&rsquo;s elbow. &ldquo;Very good
indeed. Would you like to try your skill with me;
on a little wager?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never bet,&rdquo; answered Bart, coolly, as he tried to
get a glimpse of the man&rsquo;s face. But the latter wore
a slouch hat, which was pulled well down over his
eyes, shading his features.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t mean a bet,&rdquo; was the quick answer.
&ldquo;I only meant that the loser would pay the bill for
cartridges,&rdquo; and he laughed, not unpleasantly. As
Bart had often done this with his chums, and other
lads in town, he had no objection to it, and the arrangement
was made.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What shall it be, sixteen straight?&rdquo; asked the
stranger, as he carefully selected a gun.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Double it if you like,&rdquo; replied Bart, who was
just warming up to his work.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, you&rsquo;re game, I see,&rdquo; was the laughing comment.
&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m willing. Will you go first?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll shoot sixteen shots, then you can do the same,
then I&rsquo;ll take sixteen more, and you can finish,&rdquo; answered
Bart, and this arrangement was made.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>By this time word had gotten around that some
remarkable shooting was going on in the gallery,
and it was packed almost to the doors. Bart and the
stranger had difficulty in getting room to aim properly.</p>

<p>Bart started off, and in rapid succession made
sixteen straight targets of the moving objects.
There was a cheer, and it was repeated when his
rival duplicated the lad&rsquo;s performance. Bart was
not exactly annoyed, but he felt that his reputation
was at stake. He was easily accounted the best shot
in Darewell, but now it seemed likely that he would
have to share the honors with this stranger. Bart
felt himself wishing that the man would show his
face, but the soft hat remained pulled down well
over the fellow&rsquo;s eyes.</p>

<p>Bart began on his second round, and all went well
until the last shot. Then, in some unaccountable
manner, he missed it clean. Still, his performance
was a fine one.</p>

<p>The stranger said nothing as he took his place.
Slowly and confidently he pulled the trigger, and
worked the lever that ejected the discharged shell,
and pumped a new bullet into place. For fourteen
shots he never made a miss. Then, on the fifteenth
of the second round he made a blank by a narrow
margin. A start of annoyance betrayed itself. At<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
best he could but tie Bart. Once more the gun sent
out flame and smoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Missed!&rdquo; called out Clayton, quickly, as he
looked at the target.</p>

<p>Bart had won. The stranger paused a moment, as
if to make sure that he had lost, and then, throwing
down on the counter the price for his shots and
Bart&rsquo;s, he turned to leave the place. Several stared
at him, for it seemed as if he should have said something,
or congratulated his rival, but he did not. He
pushed his way through the press of men and boys,
and reached the outer door.</p>

<p>Then, by some accident, a man brushed against
him, and the stranger&rsquo;s hat came off. Bart, who
was looking at him, could not repress an exclamation
of astonishment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; asked Clayton.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing&mdash;nothing,&rdquo; murmured Bart, quickly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come on, show us some fancy shooting,&rdquo; urged
Sandy Merton, who at one time had been an enemy
of the chums, but who was now on friendly terms
with them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;I can&rsquo;t&mdash;now,&rdquo; answered Bart, a bit shortly.
&ldquo;Come on, fellows,&rdquo; he called to Ned, Frank
and Fenn. They followed him, wondering at his
haste. Bart was making his way rapidly to the
door. Once outside he gazed up and down the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
street. It was deserted, and lay cold and silent under
the moon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s gone!&rdquo; exclaimed Bart, in disappointed
tones.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo; inquired Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That man&mdash;the man I shot against.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, what difference does that make? Did you
want another contest? You beat him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know it,&rdquo; spoke Bart quietly. &ldquo;But do you
know who he was?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered Frank and Fenn together.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was the man we saw getting into the school
the night Mrs. Long&rsquo;s diamond bracelet was taken!&rdquo;
answered Bart. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the man who can prove
that we are innocent&mdash;that&rsquo;s the thief! Come on,
let&rsquo;s see if we can catch him!&rdquo; and Bart started off
on a run.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V</h2>

<h3>AN INITIATION</h3>


<p>Hardly appreciating Bart&rsquo;s explanation, his
chums set off after him. Down the moonlit street
they sped, their footsteps ringing out on the frosty
night. But though they could not have been far
behind the man who had engaged in the shooting
contest with Bart, they caught no glimpse of him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess it&rsquo;s no use,&rdquo; remarked the leader, pulling
up as he peered down a deserted alley. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s given
us the slip.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you really think it was the same man?&rdquo;
asked Fenn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure. Didn&rsquo;t I have a good look at his face?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know you did this time, but we didn&rsquo;t
have at the school the night we were hiding in the
shadow. Are you sure it&rsquo;s the same man?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course. I had a good look at him just as he
was entering the front door of the school. The
moon was as bright as it is to-night, and he had his
hat pushed back. Oh, it&rsquo;s the same fellow all right.
Besides, didn&rsquo;t he run when he found out his face<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
had been seen? I thought there was something
suspicious about him when I was shooting against
him, but I couldn&rsquo;t tell what it was. However, he
realized that we were after him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how that can be,&rdquo; spoke Frank. &ldquo;He
doesn&rsquo;t know we&rsquo;re the fellows who are accused of
taking the bracelet, for he is a stranger in town.
And, anyway, he doesn&rsquo;t know that we saw him entering
the school&mdash;that is providing it&rsquo;s the same
man, Bart.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s the same man all right, and I wouldn&rsquo;t
be surprised but that he was suspicious of us. Else
why did he hurry away so quickly? I wish we could
have caught him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe we&rsquo;d better notify the police,&rdquo; suggested
Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; declared Bart. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve gotten along so far
without their help, and we&rsquo;ll work this out alone.
Besides, the minute we notify the police we&rsquo;ll have
to explain why we didn&rsquo;t tell about the man before,
and that won&rsquo;t do. No, we&rsquo;ll keep mum. Let&rsquo;s look
a little farther.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They continued on down the main street, with
short excursions into alleys and side thoroughfares,
but all to no purpose. No trace of the man was to
be seen, and they returned home tired from their
run, and somewhat discouraged.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>The chums said nothing to their folks of their
experience at the gallery, though Bart&rsquo;s fame as a
shot spread among his school companions, and there
was some speculation as to who the stranger might
have been.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whoever he was, he&rsquo;s almost as good a shot as
you are, Bart,&rdquo; remarked Sandy Merton. &ldquo;You
ought to arrange for a return match with him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I would&mdash;if I could find him,&rdquo; agreed
Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so he did go out rather suddenly,&rdquo; went
on Sandy. &ldquo;Do you know who he was?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I wish I did,&rdquo; murmured Bart, and then he
changed the subject, fearing Sandy might ask leading
questions.</p>

<p>The police had practically given up looking for
the diamond bracelet, and Professor Long made no
further references to it, though it was easy to see by
his manner that he had not forgotten it. An undefinable
air of suspicion hung over the four chums,
though Fenn, from the fact that he had not entered
the school, was, more or less, exempt. But he
would not have it so.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Stumpy said, &ldquo;if one of us is guilty we all
are&mdash;only, as a matter of fact, none of us is. We&rsquo;ll
find that bracelet yet, and the missing turtle, too.
If not this fall or winter, we will this spring. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
know a new swamp where lots of turtles are, and
we&rsquo;ll have a try at that some day,&rdquo; he told his chums.</p>

<p>Meanwhile matters at school continued to fill most
of the time of the chums. The Darewell institution
was a large one, and, of late, a number of secret
societies had been formed among the junior and
senior students. Sandy Merton was president of
one of the junior organizations, known as the
&ldquo;Shamma Shig,&rdquo; in comic reference to some of the
college Greek letter fraternities.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you fellows join our society?&rdquo; Sandy
asked Bart and his chums, one day.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid we&rsquo;d be ballotted against, and it
would spoil our good records,&rdquo; answered Fenn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Get out!&rdquo; exclaimed Sandy, good-naturedly.
&ldquo;Come on, let me propose your names. We want a
bigger membership, and I can guarantee that you&rsquo;ll
get through all right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What about the initiation?&rdquo; asked Frank.
&ldquo;Some we&rsquo;ve been through have been pretty stiff.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, we don&rsquo;t claim to have the easiest rites in
the school, but they&rsquo;re not so fierce,&rdquo; replied the
president proudly. &ldquo;I can tip the fellows off, and
we can make an exception in your cases, if you like,
only&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, you don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; exclaimed Bart, quickly. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
take all that&rsquo;s coming to us&mdash;that is if we join.
We&rsquo;ll think about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The chums talked matters over among themselves
that night, and came to the conclusion that it would
be a good plan to join the &ldquo;Shamma Shigs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, then, we&rsquo;ll do it,&rdquo; concluded Bart.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll let Sandy know, and he can get the goat ready
for us to ride.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The initiation took place three days later, in the
afternoon, and was held before a &ldquo;crowded house&rdquo;
in the barn owned by Sandy&rsquo;s uncle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here are four worthy and gentle knights, who
seek admission to our ranks,&rdquo; announced Sandy,
who was disguised with a sheet, all splashed over
with red paint, to represent blood. He had a hickory
nut in his mouth, to make his voice sound deep and
hoarse, and was supported on either side by one
lad in a purple sheet, and another one in yellow, the
trio forming the &ldquo;Mystic Three.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bart, Fenn and the others were put through some
strenuous exercises, including the riding of a &ldquo;goat&rdquo;
which was a saw-horse, with knots and bumps of
wood nailed here and there on it, to represent bones.
They were dipped into the rain-water barrel by
means of a rope and pulley, and they were cast from
&ldquo;the terrible height into the awful chasm,&rdquo; which
ordeal consisted merely in being pushed down a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
space of about three feet, upon some hay, but being
blindfolded was supposed to make up for the difference.</p>

<p>Then they had to climb a steep &ldquo;mountain&rdquo; which
was an old horse tread-mill, geared up unusually
high, and finally had to &ldquo;drink the terrible cup,&rdquo;
which was supposed to be some horrible mixture,
but which was really only molasses, ginger and
water.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now for the final test,&rdquo; proposed Sandy, to the
four. &ldquo;Are ye ready for the last act, or are ye
timid and do ye shrink back from the terrible danger
that confronts ye? If so, speak, an&rsquo; ye shall be allowed
to depart in peace. But, if ye would brave
the awful dangers and gloom of the bottomless pit,
say the word, an&rsquo; then shall ye be true knights of
the Shamma Shigs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go ahead, we&rsquo;re ready,&rdquo; replied Bart, irreverently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let her flicker,&rdquo; added Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis well&mdash;blindfold them,&rdquo; ordered Sandy, giving
his red-spotted robe a shake.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What, again?&rdquo; asked Frank.</p>

<p>Sandy did not answer, but thick bandages were
put over the eyes of the candidates. Then from
sounds that took place in the barn they knew that a
horse was being hitched up.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to have a ride,&rdquo; observed Fenn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quiet, Stumpy,&rdquo; cautioned Bart, in a whisper.
&ldquo;Keep still, and let&rsquo;s see if we can catch on to what
they&rsquo;re doing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A little later their hands and feet were bound,
and the candidates were put into a large wagon, and
the drive began. It lasted for some time, and, try
as they did, Bart and his chums could not imagine in
which direction they were being taken. But, as they
were familiar with the country for several miles in
any point of the compass from Darewell, they were
not worried.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Halt!&rdquo; Sandy finally ordered, and the creaking,
jolting wagon came to a stop.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ye have one more chance, candidates,&rdquo; went on
the president, as he touched the foreheads of the
four with something cold and clammy&mdash;a hand, from
the feel of it, but it was only a rubber glove, filled
with cracked ice. &ldquo;One more chance ere ye dare
the dangers of the bottomless pit,&rdquo; went on Sandy.
&ldquo;Wilt withdraw?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Naw, let her go,&rdquo; replied Fenn nonchalantly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis well. The bottomless pit awaits ye,&rdquo;
threatened Sandy, and then, one at a time, the four
were carefully lowered over the side of the wagon,
down into some depths, as they supposed, but in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
reality only a short distance, so strangely are distances
rendered when one is blindfolded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ye are now in the pit, whence there is no escape,&rdquo;
went on Sandy, &ldquo;but, if ye are true knights,
and no craven cowards ye will come to no harm. In
one hour&rsquo;s time we shall release ye. Bide here
until we return.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His voice sounded faint and far away, but it was
only because he was speaking into a pasteboard box
he had brought along for that purpose. Then the
sound of the wagon departing was heard, and the
four chums were left, sitting they knew not where,
with their hands and feet tied, and their eyes bandaged.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<h3>AN UNEXPECTED MEETING</h3>


<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; remarked Fenn, after a somewhat long
pause, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how you fellows feel about it,
but I think they&rsquo;ve rather put it all over us; eh
Bart?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Somewhat,&rdquo; admitted the leader of the Darewell
Chums. &ldquo;But it isn&rsquo;t so bad as I expected. I
wonder where we are, anyhow?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Might be ten miles away,&rdquo; observed Frank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wager we&rsquo;re not more than half a mile from
home,&rdquo; came from Ned. &ldquo;They drove roundabout
to fool us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I think,&rdquo; remarked Bart. &ldquo;Anyhow
we&rsquo;ve got to stay here an hour, and I don&rsquo;t
much fancy it, either. But since we&rsquo;ve gone this
far we might as well go the whole distance, I suppose.
It&rsquo;s a good thing it&rsquo;s comparatively warm, or
it wouldn&rsquo;t be any fun staying here. Where are we,
anyhow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to find out!&rdquo; declared Fenn suddenly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How, Stumpy?&rdquo; asked Frank.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve almost got one hand loose. I&rsquo;ll soon have
it out, and then I&rsquo;m going to take off this bandage.
There&rsquo;s no use of us staying here like a lot of chickens
tied up, when we can just as well get away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the trouble&mdash;we can&rsquo;t get away,&rdquo; came
from Frank. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been trying for the last ten minutes
to loosen these cords, but I can&rsquo;t slip a single
knot. They knew how to tie &rsquo;em all right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You just watch me,&rdquo; called Fenn, who was
squirming about on a bed of leaves.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Watch you&mdash;yes, with our eyes bandaged,&rdquo; said
Ned, sarcastically. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a hot one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Patience, noble knight,&rdquo; mocked the stout lad,
&ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll soon release ye.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stumpy is so fat that they didn&rsquo;t have rope
enough to tie him,&rdquo; remarked Bart. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the reason
he thinks he can get loose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it, I know it!&rdquo; cried Fenn in triumph
a few seconds afterward. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got both
hands out, and now here comes off my bandage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A moment later Fenn uttered a cry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; asked Bart, making an unsuccessful
attempt to get rid of the ropes binding
his arms and legs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why we&rsquo;re in Oak Swamp, or, right on the edge
of it,&rdquo; replied Fenn. &ldquo;They brought us farther than
I thought they did. But we&rsquo;ll fool &rsquo;em all right.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
We&rsquo;ll get loose, skip out, and when they come back
they won&rsquo;t find us. Wait until I get these ropes off
my legs, and I&rsquo;ll help you fellows.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fenn was as good as his word. A few seconds
later he was free from his bonds, and, in turn, he
released Bart, Frank and Ned. They all looked
around in some surprise, for they had no idea that
they had been brought so far from home. The
wagon had traveled faster than they had suspected.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oak Swamp,&rdquo; mused Bart. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good thing
it&rsquo;s coming on winter instead of summer, or we&rsquo;d be
eaten up with mosquitoes. Well, let&rsquo;s get out of
here. I don&rsquo;t like the place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Indeed it was gloomy and dismal enough at any
time, but now, on a late fall evening, with darkness
fast approaching, it was anything but an inviting
place. The swamp derived its name from a number
of scrub oak trees that grew in it. During the summer
it was a treacherous place to visit, for there were
deep muck holes scattered through it, and more than
one cow, and several horses, had broken out of the
pastures, and wandered into the wet place, only to
sink down to their deaths. It was said that several
years before a man had endeavored to cross the
swamp, had been caught in a bog hole, and sucked
down into its depths, his body never having been
recovered.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>So it was with a feeling of no little satisfaction
that Bart and his chums found themselves able to
leave the gloomy place sooner than they had expected.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be a good joke on the others,&rdquo; remarked
Ned, as he gathered into a heap, the rope fetters
that had bound him. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll sneak away, and when
those fellows come back for us they&rsquo;ll think we&rsquo;ve
rolled into the swamp, and sunk, and they may make
a search for us. Let&rsquo;s hide the cords and bandages.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; agreed Frank. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll turn the tables
on them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, whatever we do, let&rsquo;s get away from here,&rdquo;
suggested Fenn. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s too gloomy for my notion.
Look, there&rsquo;s the ledge they lowered us from. It
isn&rsquo;t two feet high, but it seemed like a hundred,&rdquo;
and he pointed to a small ledge of rock, where
Sandy Merton and his mates had stood as they lowered
from the wagon the lads who were being initiated.
Had it not been that Sandy stood on the end
of the vehicle, he would not have been high enough
to bring about the delusion of the boys going down
into some bottomless pit.</p>

<p>The four chums had gathered up the severed
ropes, and, folding the bandages up in them, hid
them all under a big stone. Then they started for
home.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>Oak Swamp was several miles from the town of
Darewell, but there was a fairly good road between
the places, since the swamp was but slightly off
to one side of the main thoroughfare. As the four
started off, with Fenn in the lead, they chuckled to
think of the blank looks of the initiating team,
when the members should return for the candidates,
to find them missing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I almost wish we could stay, and hide, and hear
what they&rsquo;ll say,&rdquo; observed Ned, laughing at the
prospect.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t. I want to get home,&rdquo; came from Frank.
&ldquo;Ugh! This is a gloomy place after dark.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Suddenly Fenn, who was some distance in the
lead, jumped to one side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter; see a snake?&rdquo; called Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A snake, this time of year? Not much, but it&rsquo;s
a whopping big mud turtle,&rdquo; cried the fleshy lad.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to catch it, fellows. Maybe it&rsquo;s the one
that got away from Professor Long&rsquo;s collection.
That&rsquo;s the only way I can account for a turtle being
out of doors at this season of the year.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And while you&rsquo;re at it look and see if it hasn&rsquo;t
got a diamond bracelet on its neck, and a wedding
ring on its toes, Stumpy,&rdquo; advised Bart, mockingly.
&ldquo;If it has, it&rsquo;ll be all to the mustard, and we&rsquo;ll be
cleared of suspicion. Look and see if it has its teeth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
filled with gold, while you&rsquo;re about it, but, above all,
don&rsquo;t forget the diamond bracelet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aw, let up, can&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; begged Stumpy.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the use of poking fun at a fellow all the
while, just because I made one break. Besides a
turtle <i>might</i> get its neck through the bracelet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh rats!&rdquo; was Bart&rsquo;s reply. &ldquo;But catch the
turtle, if you&rsquo;re going to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fenn made a grab for the slow moving reptile,
and caught it. He examined it carefully in the fast-fading
light.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, pick off the diamond bracelet; why don&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo; asked Bart, chuckling at his joke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dry up!&rdquo; advised Fenn, still looking at the
turtle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Chuck it away, and come on,&rdquo; suggested Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Chuck it away? I will not!&rdquo; retorted Fenn indignantly.
&ldquo;This is a rare kind of turtle, it must
have been dug up out of its winter hole by some one.
I&rsquo;m going to keep it for my collection.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What? Haven&rsquo;t you given that up by this
time?&rdquo; asked Bart. &ldquo;I supposed that you&rsquo;d be gathering
specimens of snowflakes, or samples of dog
biscuit by this time,&rdquo; for he knew Fenn&rsquo;s failing,
and a month, at most, was the period devoted to any
new fad. But this time Fenn seemed more in
earnest.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m going to keep this,&rdquo; went on the amateur
collector. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good one. I shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised
but what Professor Long would be glad to get it for
his collection,&rdquo; and Fenn gazed admiringly at the
turtle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s another,&rdquo; announced Frank suddenly.
&ldquo;And there is a third one,&rdquo; and he pointed to two
more of the reptiles crawling sluggishly along.</p>

<p>Fenn ran over and examined them, but he took
care not to lose his first specimen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re a common variety,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t want &rsquo;em for my collection, and Professor
Long has several like them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And neither one wears a diamond bracelet&mdash;how
sad,&rdquo; chimed in Bart, laughingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right&mdash;make fun if you want to,&rdquo; said
Fenn, a bit sharply, &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s no joke to be under the
disgrace of the implied accusation that we stole the
bracelet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know it,&rdquo; agreed Bart soberly, &ldquo;but looking for
mud turtles that might possibly have it on their
necks isn&rsquo;t going to help matters any. We might
much better look for the man who was in the school
just before we were. If any one took it, he did&mdash;not
some turtle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s possible that a turtle did poke its head
and neck through the bracelet when it was in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
cabinet,&rdquo; said Ned, &ldquo;but, of course, it&rsquo;s out of the
question to think that we can find that turtle, or, for
that matter, that the bracelet would remain on the
turtle&rsquo;s neck.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Guess you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; admitted Stumpy. &ldquo;Well,
I&rsquo;ve got a good turtle for my collection, anyhow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it funny so many of &rsquo;em are out to-day?&rdquo;
asked Ned, as the four walked on, Fenn carefully
carrying his prize. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s so near winter I should
think they&rsquo;d be going to sleep, like a bear, in a hollow
log, if they do sleep in logs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, they curl up and go to sleep in some warm
place for the winter,&rdquo; declared Fenn, who considered
himself a sort of authority on the reptiles.
&ldquo;But the reason so many are out to-day is because
it has suddenly turned warmer. They&rsquo;ll soon be going
into permanent winter quarters though. But
come on, it&rsquo;s getting dark. Let&rsquo;s get a move on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder but what we&rsquo;d have snow,&rdquo;
observed Bart, casting a look at the clouds. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
about time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish it would,&rdquo; said Ned, &ldquo;or else that we&rsquo;d
have skating. But what about going camping, Bart?
Have you thought any more about it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and I think I can arrange so we can go. I
feel just like going off in the woods with our guns.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;To hunt mud turtles with diamond bracelets,&rdquo;
put in Frank, with a laugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, mud turtles or anything else that comes our
way,&rdquo; went on Bart. &ldquo;Yes, I think we&rsquo;ll have a
winter camp this season, and if we do&mdash;&rdquo; He
stopped suddenly, and appeared to be looking at
some object just ahead in the woods, for the boys
were now out of the swamp proper. Bart&rsquo;s chums
followed his gaze.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a man,&rdquo; observed Fenn, in a low voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and he seems to be looking for something,&rdquo;
remarked Bart, guardedly. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s poking away the
leaves with a stick. Look at him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man was, as yet, not aware of the presence of
the boys. He was walking slowly along, with his
head bent over, as if eagerly scanning the ground.
Now and then he poked away the dead leaves with
his stick. A moment later, as the four chums could
see in the little light that lingered after an early sunset,
the man stooped over, and picked up something.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A turtle! He&rsquo;s looking for mud turtles!&rdquo; gasped
Fenn, for it could be seen that the man had picked
up one of the reptiles that seemed to be unusually
numerous that day. Unconsciously Fenn had spoken
louder than he intended, and the man heard him.
He turned quickly, gave one startled look at the
boys, appearing ill at ease at the unexpected meeting,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
and then, wheeling around, he made off through the
woods, soon being lost to sight amid the trees.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He took the turtle with him!&rdquo; exclaimed Fenn.
&ldquo;He must be collecting them, too!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and did you notice who he was?&rdquo; asked
Bart, who appeared to be laboring under some excitement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. Who?&rdquo; gasped Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The mysterious stranger who entered the school
just before we did&mdash;the man who shot against me at
the gallery! Fellows, it&rsquo;s the same man&mdash;we must
catch him!&rdquo; and, as he had done that night in the
shooting gallery, Bart darted after the stranger, followed
by his chums, Fenn still carrying the turtle.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<h3>GETTING READY FOR CAMP</h3>


<p>&ldquo;Come on, fellows!&rdquo; exclaimed Bart, as he
stumbled on ahead. &ldquo;We mustn&rsquo;t lose sight of him
again! There&rsquo;s some mystery about that man. I
believe he stole the diamond bracelet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Slipping, and almost tripping over sticks, fallen
trees, stumps and stones, the chums hurried on. But
the man had a number of advantages. He had a
start of several hundred feet, darkness was coming
on, and he evidently knew the paths through the
woods better than did the boys, for when they
caught occasional glimpses of him he appeared to be
running at full speed, whereas they had to go slowly,
and pick their way.</p>

<p>At last they could see him no more, and, as it
seemed to grow rapidly darker, the boys were forced
to give up the chase.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, wouldn&rsquo;t that get on your nerves?&rdquo; Bart
demanded of his chums, as they stopped for breath.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the third time we&rsquo;ve seen that man, and the
second time he&rsquo;s gotten away.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;The next time he sees us he&rsquo;ll know enough to
run without waiting to take a second look at us,&rdquo;
observed Frank, grimly.</p>

<p>There was little use lingering longer in the woods,
the chums decided, so, after a last look about, hoping
for a sight of the mysterious stranger, they once
more started for home. It was quite dark as they got
out on the main highway, and to their great delight
they saw approaching Jed Sneed, a teamster whom
they knew. He readily consented to give them a
ride back to town.</p>

<p>As they were nearing the centre of Darewell Ned
exclaimed:</p>

<p>&ldquo;By jove, I believe it&rsquo;s snowing! I felt a flake on
my face.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; added Bart, a moment later. &ldquo;It
<i>is</i> snowing,&rdquo; and a little flurry of white flakes confirmed
his words.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and I don&rsquo;t like to see it,&rdquo; remarked Jed,
the teamster, as he cracked his whip, to hasten the
pace of his horses.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; asked Frank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because it&rsquo;s a sign we&rsquo;re going to have a long,
hard winter,&rdquo; went on the man, who was rather an
odd character, and a great believer in signs of various
kinds. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a sure sign of a hard winter when
it snows just before the new moon,&rdquo; Jed went on.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be new moon to-night, and we&rsquo;re going to have
quite a storm. Besides it&rsquo;s down in my almanack
that we&rsquo;re going to have a bad spell of weather about
now. I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder but what we&rsquo;d have quite
a fall before morning,&rdquo; and certainly it seemed so,
for the flurry was increasing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sandy and those fellows will have lots of fun
hunting for us,&rdquo; remarked Ned with a chuckle.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll think we&rsquo;ve been snowed under.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see Sandy Merton, and two or three lads in a
wagon, just before I met you chaps,&rdquo; observed Jed.
&ldquo;They asked me if I&rsquo;d met you, but I hadn&rsquo;t&mdash;up to
then. What&rsquo;s up? Been playing jokes on each
other?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They tried one on us, but I think it&rsquo;s on them,&rdquo;
said Bart. &ldquo;Well, here&rsquo;s where I get off, fellows.
Come over to-night, and we&rsquo;ll have a talk,&rdquo; and Bart
was about to descend from the wagon, as his street
was reached first.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hold on! Wait a minute! Don&rsquo;t get down on
that side!&rdquo; cried Jed, earnestly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter; is the step on this side
broken?&rdquo; asked Bart, in some alarm, as he hastily
checked himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, but you started to get down with your left
foot first,&rdquo; explained the teamster. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s sure to
bring the worst kind of bad luck on a fellow. My<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
team might run away before I get two blocks
further. It&rsquo;s a bad sign to get out with your left
foot first. Don&rsquo;t do it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Jed, you&rsquo;re a regular old woman!&rdquo; exclaimed
Bart good-naturedly, for he and his chums
were on familiar terms with the teamster. Nevertheless
the lad did as requested, and changed his
position, so as to leave the wagon in accordance
with the superstitious notions of Jed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s better,&rdquo; remarked the man, with an air of
relief, as Bart descended. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he added, as he
drove on, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re going to have quite a storm.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was right, for that night the ground was
covered with the white flakes, but the thermometer
did not get down very low.</p>

<p>After supper Bart&rsquo;s three chums called on him,
and, a little later they received an unexpected visit
from Sandy Merton and some of his friends. The
latter were much worried when they had gone back
to Oak Swamp, and had failed to find a sign of the
candidates whom they had initiated into the &ldquo;Shamma
Shig&rdquo; society.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, that&rsquo;s a nice trick to play on a fellow,&rdquo; declared
Sandy, indignantly, when he found that Bart
and his friends were safe and snug at home. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve
been hunting all around that swamp in the dark for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
you, and we&rsquo;re all wet and muddy. Why didn&rsquo;t
you stay there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t think it was healthy,&rdquo; observed Bart, with
a chuckle. &ldquo;You told us you wouldn&rsquo;t be back for an
hour, so we concluded to leave. You should tie
your ropes better, Sandy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We weren&rsquo;t going to leave you there an hour,&rdquo;
went on the president of the secret society. &ldquo;That
was only a joke on you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, our coming away was only a joke on you,&rdquo;
declared Ned with a grin. &ldquo;Are we full-fledged
members now, Sandy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose so,&rdquo; was the somewhat ungracious answer.
Then as Sandy&rsquo;s chums declared that the
manner in which they had been outwitted by the
four chums was perfectly fair, it was agreed to call
the incident closed, and consider the initiation
finished.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re now regular members,&rdquo; declared Sandy,
&ldquo;and you can come to the meeting to-night, if you
want to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The chums went to a &ldquo;hall&rdquo; that had been fitted
up over the barn of Sandy&rsquo;s uncle. It had all the
features of a regular secret society meeting room,
with inner and outer sentinels, a hole cut in the
door, through which doubtful visitors could be
scrutinized; and once inside a more or less blood-curdling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
ritual was gone through with. But the
boys enjoyed it, and, his good nature restored by
presiding at the function, Sandy told how he and
his friends had been much alarmed at finding Bart
and his companions missing, and how they had
searched in vain for them.</p>

<p>A thaw, a few days after the storm, removed
most of the snow, but it remained long enough for
some coasting, in which our heroes took part. Meanwhile
they had made some guarded inquiries regarding
the mysterious man, but had learned nothing.
No one else seemed to have observed him, or, if they
had, they thought nothing of it.</p>

<p>Nor was any trace found of the missing diamond
bracelet. The police had practically given up work
on the case, but the boys had not. They felt the
stigma that still attached to them, and they resolved,
if it was at all possible, to remove it. The parents
of the lads were somewhat indignant that there
should be even a suspicion against them, but there
seemed to be no help for it, and Mr. Long, thinking
to better matters, offered a reward for the return of
the property. But he had no answers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Bart, what about camp?&rdquo; asked Ned, one
cold morning in December, when an overcast sky
gave promise of more snow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was just thinking it was time we got down to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
business about it,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m ready to
go, if you fellows are. I&rsquo;ve spoken to my folks, and
they&rsquo;re willing I should take two weeks out of
school, besides the regular Christmas holidays.
There&rsquo;s not much doing the week before that vacation,
and not much the one after. That will give
us nearly a month&mdash;the last half of December and
the first half of January.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good idea,&rdquo; commented Frank. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I can
go. Dad is going west to visit some relatives, and,
as I don&rsquo;t care about making the trip, I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;ll
let me go to a winter camp.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t asked yet, but I&rsquo;m sure I can go,&rdquo; said
Fenn, and Ned was also hopeful.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, suppose we go down to my house after
school, and look over our camping stuff,&rdquo; suggested
Bart, for the tents, stoves and other paraphernalia
was kept in his barn. The boys had gone camping
several times before, both winter and summer, and
had a very complete outfit, as is known to those who
have perused the other volumes of this series.</p>

<p>Bart&rsquo;s idea met with favor and, when lessons
for the day were over, the four chums were overhauling
cots, inspecting the big tent and seeing if the
portable stove was in good condition. It was a
dark, lowering afternoon, and, since morning, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
promise of more snow had been added to by several
flurries of the white flakes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, everything seems to be in good shape,&rdquo; observed
Bart at length. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got about two more
weeks of school, and then we&rsquo;ll cut it, and hike for
the woods. We must look up a good place, and you
and Stumpy had better find out for sure if you can
go, Ned.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will,&rdquo; they promised.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, then come on out, and let&rsquo;s try a few
shots,&rdquo; went on Bart. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got some new cartridges,
with smokeless powder, and I want to see
how they work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A little later the four chums were ready to take
turns with two rifles Bart owned. The target was
set up in the deserted orchard, and the fun began.</p>

<p>Bart was easily the best shot of the four, and this
was so soon demonstrated that he consented to take
his aim in difficult positions, such as firing with his
back to the target, using a mirror to sight with. He
did other &ldquo;stunts&rdquo; which, I have no doubt, some of
my readers have seen done in &ldquo;Wild West&rdquo; shows,
or on the stage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no use talking, Bart,&rdquo; observed Ned,
&ldquo;you can put it all over us when it comes to handling
a rifle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve had more practice,&rdquo; said Bart modestly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
&ldquo;You fellows will do as good when you&rsquo;ve
had more experience.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid not,&rdquo; spoke Fenn, with a sigh.
&ldquo;Here, see if I can hit that tin can on the fence
post.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He raised the weapon, sighted it carefully, and
pulled the trigger. There was no smoke, for the
powder was of the self-consuming type, but a bright
sliver of flame shot from the muzzle of the gun,
plainly visible in the fast-gathering darkness. The
can was not touched, but, an instant after Fenn fired,
some one beyond the fence set up a great shouting.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Great Caesar, Stumpy, you&rsquo;ve shot some one!&rdquo;
gasped Bart.</p>

<p>Poor Fenn turned a sickly color, and the rifle fell
from his nerveless hands. The shouts continued,
and there was a commotion in the bushes.</p>

<p>A little later Alice Keene, with her hands full of
bandages, and carrying a small medicine chest,
rushed from the house and past the group of terror-stricken
lads toward the fence, whence the yells continued
to come.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; cried the girl. &ldquo;I was afraid some one
would get hurt when you boys used those horrid
guns! You had better telephone for a doctor, Bart,
while I go see if I can stop the bleeding! Who is
hurt?&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;We&mdash;we don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; faltered Fenn. &ldquo;I was
shooting at a can, but I missed it. I didn&rsquo;t know
anybody was in the bushes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bart hurried into the house to telephone for a
physician, while Alice in the rle of a red-cross
nurse, hurried on toward the fence. The shouts
were growing fainter now. The boys, with white
faces, followed her.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<h3>AN ODD LETTER</h3>


<p>&ldquo;Suppose he is dead?&rdquo; faltered Fenn, as he
stumbled along. &ldquo;Will&mdash;will I be arrested.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry until you see who it is, and how
badly he is hurt,&rdquo; advised Frank. They were soon
at the fence. Ned and Frank parted the bushes that
grew higher than the topmost rail, and plunged on
through. Fenn followed, but Alice was going
farther up, where she knew there was a gate.</p>

<p>The sight that met the eyes of the boys was most
reassuring. Standing up on his big wagon was
Jed Sneed, calmly pitching off cord wood into a
pile. The fuel was evidently for Bart&rsquo;s house.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Were you&mdash;are you&mdash;that is&mdash;you aren&rsquo;t dead;
are you?&rdquo; gasped Fenn. &ldquo;Is&mdash;is anybody?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not that I know of,&rdquo; answered Jed, as he
straightened up. &ldquo;But I come pretty nigh bein&rsquo;. As
nigh as I want to. I just heard a bullet sing over my
head, as I was stooping down to get hold of a stick.
Who was shooting, anyhow?&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I was,&rdquo; faltered Stumpy. &ldquo;I missed the tin
can I aimed at. Did I come very close to you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t take time to measure the distance,&rdquo; announced
Jed dryly, &ldquo;but it was close enough.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We heard you yell,&rdquo; said Frank, &ldquo;and we
thought some one was killed. We didn&rsquo;t know it
was you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was hollering at the horses, partly,&rdquo; explained
the man. &ldquo;The pesky critters won&rsquo;t stand still when
they hear shootin&rsquo;. So it was you fellows; eh?
Well, I ought to have knowed better than to come
out with this load of wood to-day. Jest as I was
startin&rsquo; a black cat run right across the road in
front of the horses, and that&rsquo;s one of the very worst
kind of bad signs. I should have turned back, but
Mr. Keene wanted this wood to-day, so I kept on.
Then, as if one warnin&rsquo; wasn&rsquo;t enough, I had another.
Jest as I was turnin&rsquo; in this back way,
thinkin&rsquo; it would be a little shorter, three crows flew
over my head, goin&rsquo; South. They must have stayed
up pretty late, but there&rsquo;s no worse sign than three
crows, unless it&rsquo;s to meet a snake with his tail
toward you. But, as Mr. Keene wanted the wood,
I come on, and look what was the result&mdash;I was
nearly killed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I guess the bullet didn&rsquo;t come so near you
as you thought,&rdquo; suggested Ned, partly for Fenn&rsquo;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
benefit. &ldquo;Fenn usually fires high, and he missed the
can clean. Then, you&rsquo;re down in a sort of hollow
here, and I guess it was well over your head.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope so,&rdquo; remarked Jed. &ldquo;A miss is as good
as a mile, I guess. Still, it was partly my own fault,
for not payin&rsquo; attention to them signs. You can
make up your minds I won&rsquo;t tempt fate that way
again. I&rsquo;ll turn back next time when a black cat
crosses in front of me. And then, too, I ought to
have give you chaps warnin&rsquo;. I heard you shootin&rsquo;
as I drove up, and then, when it stopped, I s&rsquo;posed
you was done. Then when that one shot came, and
whizzed over my head, I thought it was all up with
me. I hollered some, to let you know I was here,
and to quiet the team. Then I went on tossin&rsquo; off
the wood.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fenn breathed easier. Some color was beginning
to come back into his cheeks. A moment later Alice
came hurrying along, having found the gate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is he badly hurt?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Have they got
him in the wagon? Perhaps you&rsquo;d better drive right
to the hospital Mr. Sneed,&rdquo; for she knew the
teamster, who did odd jobs around town.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wa&rsquo;al, I don&rsquo;t mind drivin&rsquo; to the hospital for
ye,&rdquo; announced Jed with a grin, &ldquo;but there ain&rsquo;t no
need for it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me he&rsquo;s&mdash;&rdquo; but Alice paused, not willing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
to utter the fatal word. Several rolls of bandages
fell from her hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m all right,&rdquo; went on Jed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll live to be
an old man if I wait to be shot, I guess. Whoa,
there, ponies,&rdquo; this last to his team.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then isn&rsquo;t any one hurt?&rdquo; asked Alice, and
though she was undoubtedly glad of it, there was a
distinct note of disappointment in her voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No one,&rdquo; explained Ned, as he told how it had
happened. Jed took part of the blame, for not announcing
his presence, but, nevertheless, Fenn was
a bit shaky for some time after the incident, and
Ned and the others were nervous.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The doctor will be right over!&rdquo; suddenly cried
Bart, bursting through the bushes. &ldquo;Who is it, and
is he badly hurt?&rdquo; Then he had to be told how it
was, and he hurried back into the house to countermand
the order for the physician. Alice gathered
up her bandages, and with her box of remedies
retraced her steps. She had missed a chance to
practice for her chosen profession, but she was glad
of it.</p>

<p>A more careful investigation of how Fenn had
stood when he shot, and a calculation of the angle
at which he held the rifle, showed that the bullet
must have gone well over Jed&rsquo;s head, so it was not
so bad as at first thought.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;But it was mostly my own fault,&rdquo; concluded the
odd man, as he drove away. &ldquo;Never again will I
keep on when I see a black cat&mdash;&rdquo; He stopped suddenly,
checked his team, and got out of the empty
wagon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter now?&rdquo; asked Frank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a horseshoe in the field there, and it&rsquo;s
turned the wrong way for luck,&rdquo; explained Jed, as
he picked it up. &ldquo;I was drivin&rsquo; right toward it&mdash;must
have come off one of my horses when I was
comin&rsquo; around to get a good place to toss off the
wood.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anyway it had the curved, or open side, toward
me, and if you go toward a horseshoe that way it&rsquo;s
a sure sign that you&rsquo;ll have no luck in a year. A
mighty sure sign, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you going to do?&rdquo; asked Bart, as he
saw Jed put the shoe back on the ground again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I just turned it around again. Now I can
drive toward it right, and I&rsquo;ll have good luck&mdash;you
see,&rdquo; which he proceeded to do, and, after his wagon
had passed the shoe, he got out again, picked it up,
and then went on, well satisfied with himself.</p>

<p>As the days went on the weather grew colder.
There were frequent snow storms, and the snow did
not melt. The Christmas holidays were approaching,
and the boys were preparing for camp life, each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
lad having secured permission to take some time out
of school.</p>

<p>One night, when the four chums were at Fenn&rsquo;s
house, getting ready some things, and talking of the
fun they expected to have, there came a knock on
the front door. As the boys were the only ones
downstairs, Fenn volunteered to answer it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Though I don&rsquo;t know who can be calling at this
hour,&rdquo; he remarked, for it was nearly ten o&rsquo;clock.
He opened the door, and his startled exclamation
brought his chums to his side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no one here!&rdquo; cried the stout lad, &ldquo;but
I was sure I heard a knock&mdash;didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; replied Bart, and the others nodded.
&ldquo;There has been some one here,&rdquo; went on Bart.
&ldquo;See the footprints in the snow. It&rsquo;s snowed since
we came. Some one ran up, knocked, and ran away
again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder what for?&rdquo; murmured Fenn, looking
up and down the deserted street. &ldquo;Probably a joke.
Maybe it was Sandy Merton.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whoever it was, he left something,&rdquo; said Frank,
suddenly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; asked Fenn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This letter,&rdquo; answered Frank, picking up a missive
from the doorstep. The white envelope, so
much like the snow, had not at first been noticed.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Bring it in and see what it says,&rdquo; proposed Bart,
and soon, under the light of the gas in the dining-room,
the boys were perusing the strange missive.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s to me,&rdquo; said Fenn, as he rapidly scanned it.
&ldquo;But what in the world does it mean? And it has
no signature. Listen to this fellows,&rdquo; and he read:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="noi">&ldquo;&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Mr. Fenn Masterson</span>,</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Dear Sir:&mdash;I understand you have quite a collection
of mud turtles. Would you be willing to part
with them? I mean for a consideration, of course.
If you would kindly communicate with me. I will
pay you a good price for all the turtles you have.
But I must make this stipulation, which, at first may
seem odd to you. But I have a reason for it. I can
not meet you personally. If you are willing to sell
your turtles will you write a note to that effect, and
leave it in the dead sycamore tree on the edge of
Oak Swamp? That is the only way in which you
can communicate with me. Kindly let me hear from
you soon.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>As Fenn had said, there was no signature. He
turned the strange letter over and looked at the back.
It was blank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, wouldn&rsquo;t that jar you!&rdquo; exclaimed Bart,
as he took the note from Fenn&rsquo;s hand.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<h3>OFF TO CAMP</h3>


<p>&ldquo;This must be a joke,&rdquo; remarked Fenn, at length,
after he had once more read the note. &ldquo;Sandy Merton,
or some of the other fellows, who want to have
some fun with us, wrote that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think not,&rdquo; said Frank, thoughtfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; inquired Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some man wrote that,&rdquo; went on Frank. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
no boy&rsquo;s handwriting. There&rsquo;s too much character
to it. What are you going to do about it, Fenn?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing, I guess. Of course, I&rsquo;d sell my turtles
and things, if I got a chance, for I think I&rsquo;m going
to collect different kinds of wood now, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did I tell you?&rdquo; interrupted Ned triumphantly.
&ldquo;I knew Fenn&rsquo;s fad wouldn&rsquo;t last much
longer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would, if we weren&rsquo;t going camping,&rdquo; declared
the stout youth, with vigor. &ldquo;Only when I&rsquo;m
away there&rsquo;ll be nobody to look after the things.
Mother is afraid to feed &rsquo;em, and dad won&rsquo;t, so if
I had a good chance to get rid of &rsquo;em I&rsquo;d do it. Only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
I wouldn&rsquo;t do business with a fellow like this, who
doesn&rsquo;t sign his name, and who wants me to act as
if I was leaving money in response to a black-hand
note. I&rsquo;ll not pay any attention to it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would, if I were you,&rdquo; said Frank, quietly, but
with some determination.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You would?&rdquo; asked Bart, in some surprise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure. I think there&rsquo;s something back of this,&rdquo;
went on Frank. &ldquo;If I were Fenn I&rsquo;d enter into a correspondence
with him, and try to find out what was
at the bottom of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you think it is?&rdquo; asked Ned. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s
make another examination of the letter, detective
style, and see what we can deduce from it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think the man who wrote that letter is the same
man we have met several times&mdash;the mysterious
stranger who entered the school&mdash;the man who stole
the diamond bracelet,&rdquo; spoke Frank, quickly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then if you&rsquo;ve got it all figured out, we don&rsquo;t
need to puzzle over this letter,&rdquo; decided Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;m altogether right,&rdquo; came from
Frank quickly. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s only one theory.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I think it a good one,&rdquo; added Bart. &ldquo;Fenn,
suppose you answer this letter, and leave your
reply in the dead sycamore tree.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What shall I say?&rdquo; asked the heavy-weight
chum.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you don&rsquo;t need to be specific. Say you don&rsquo;t
like to do business this way, that you prefer to meet
the writer. Then we&rsquo;ll leave the letter in the tree,
hide, and nab him when he comes for it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; cried Ned. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the stuff. Regular
detective business, fellows. Come on, Fenn, write
the letter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think that would be a good plan,&rdquo; commented
Frank, who, being more sober-minded than his
chums usually were, often said the final word when
some scheme was afoot. &ldquo;If the writer wants to resort
to such tactics as leaving an anonymous letter
on the doorstep, we can retaliate by playing the spy
on him. Get busy, Fenn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When shall we leave it in the tree?&rdquo; asked the
stout lad.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To-morrow,&rdquo; answered Bart promptly. &ldquo;We
haven&rsquo;t any too much time before going to camp.
We&rsquo;ll try to catch him to-morrow, and maybe we can
solve the mystery of the diamond bracelet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It took some time to compose a letter to the satisfaction
of all four lads, as each one had some suggestion
to make, but it was finally done, and enclosed
in a strong, manilla envelope, ready to be left in the
dead sycamore tree. Then the chums planned to go
to Oak Swamp the next afternoon, early.</p>

<p>The appointed time found them at the place, and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
as they came in sight of the tree, they adopted precautionary
tactics previously agreed upon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For,&rdquo; Bart explained, &ldquo;we want to catch that
man, and we&rsquo;ve got to go about it right. He&rsquo;s given
us the slip a number of times. Now, naturally, he&rsquo;ll
expect us to-day, and he&rsquo;ll be in hiding somewhere
near the tree. Look around carefully, and see if we
can&rsquo;t spot him before we deposit the letter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Accordingly, the lads made a cautious approach,
but there was no sign of a man, or any one else near
the big tree. The approach to the swamp appeared
deserted, and on that afternoon, with a dull, leaden
sky overhead, and a mournful wind sighing through
the trees, Oak Swamp was anything but a cheerful
place.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to snow,&rdquo; observed Ned, as they
walked slowly on toward the tree.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Keep quiet,&rdquo; advised Bart, in a sharp whisper.
&ldquo;The man may be in hiding.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There were patches of snow on the ground about
the sycamore, but an examination of them did not
disclose any human footprints, though there were
squirrel and rabbit tracks which gave the boys hope
that they would get plenty of game when they went
to their winter camp.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He hasn&rsquo;t been here,&rdquo; was Fenn&rsquo;s opinion, as he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
took his letter and stuck it in a conspicuous place in a
crack in the bark.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ll hide and wait for him,&rdquo; decided Bart.</p>

<p>The four lads hid themselves in the thick underbrush
not far from the tree, where each one could
command a good view of it, and the path leading to
it. They agreed, on a signal from Bart, to rush out,
and, if possible, grab the mysterious man in case he
should appear.</p>

<p>Then began a period of waiting, and it was made
all the more tiresome from the fact that the boys
could not be together and talk. They had to crouch
down, in uncomfortable positions, not moving, for
fear of betraying themselves, and, of course, it was
out of the question to talk. The hours dragged. It
seemed to grow dark suddenly, but it was due to the
thickening of the storm clouds overhead. Then
came some flurries of snow, which ceased from time
to time, and then, with a suddenness that was startling,
the storm broke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No use waiting any longer,&rdquo; called Fenn, rising
up from behind his bush, and peering through the
swirling flakes. &ldquo;He won&rsquo;t come now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Keep quiet, he may,&rdquo; ordered Bart, and though
the storm raged, they kept up their vigil half an hour
longer. By this time it was so dark that the sycamore
tree could scarcely be distinguished, and even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
Bart declared it was useless to remain longer. They
started for home, the storm increasing every minute,
and they left the letter in the tree, in case the man
might arrive.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This will be fine weather for camping,&rdquo; cried
Ned exultantly, as he plowed through a small drift.</p>

<p>They began their preparations for camping the
next day. It did not take them long to get their
things in readiness, for they had spent several days
overhauling their outfits. The tents, one for sleeping
and the other for cooking and eating in, were
rolled up, cots were folded, the stove, cooking pots
and pans, were placed in boxes, provisions were purchased,
and the bedding examined. Of course, the
lads did not forget their guns, and they had a good
supply of ammunition.</p>

<p>As to the location of their camp, they had settled
on it only after a strenuous debate. Fenn and
Frank were for going to the one where they had previously
had such good luck hunting wild turkeys,
but Bart and Ned wanted to go to a less frequented
part of the State, where larger game, such as an
occasional bear or deer, could be had, and, in the
end they carried their point, though it meant a longer
trip, and necessitated going by railroad.</p>

<p>Finally all was in readiness, the last of the packing
had been done, good-byes had been said, Alice had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
made up a little medicine chest for her brother, and
Jennie Smith had even composed an &ldquo;original poem&rdquo;
in honor of the occasion.</p>

<p>Jed Sneed had taken the camp stuff to the express
office in his big sled, and was to come back for the
four chums, who carried their guns with them. The
storm had hardly ceased, and there was plenty of
snow on the ground.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;ll you boys do if you get snowed in?&rdquo;
asked Mr. Keene as he watched his son and the
others getting in Jed&rsquo;s sled, for the start was made
from Bart&rsquo;s house.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;ll wait until it thaws,&rdquo; replied Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take care of yourselves,&rdquo; admonished Mrs.
Keene.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And drink hot ginger tea in case you get wet,&rdquo;
ordered Alice, with her most professional air.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; chorused the boys.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All ready?&rdquo; asked Jed, as he looked around.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All ready!&rdquo; replied Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gid-dap!&rdquo; called Jed, cracking the whip, and the
horses plunged forward into a drift, the bells jingling
a merry tune. The start for camp had been made.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X"></a>CHAPTER X</h2>

<h3>A RAILROAD ACCIDENT</h3>


<p>Jogging along the road to the depot, the four
chums asked each other all sorts of questions, as to
whether this or that article had been included in the
camping outfit. For so much remained to be done
at the last minute, in spite of preparations some time
ahead, that they were afraid something would be
forgotten. But, fortunately, everything necessary
seemed to have been put in the packages, which had
been shipped on ahead, so they would be there when
the campers arrived. They were to get out at the
railroad station of Cannistota, and drive ten miles
into the woods.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, what did you do about your mud turtles,
Fenn?&rdquo; asked Bart, as the sled bumped along, for the
road was rough.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I arranged with Sandy Merton to feed them.
I&rsquo;m going to pay him for it. He promised to look
after them. I hope he doesn&rsquo;t forget. Hello! there
he comes now. Hello, Sandy!&rdquo; called Fenn, as he
saw the president of the Shamma Shig secret society
plodding along through the snow.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello,&rdquo; responded Sandy, transferring his bundle
of books from one arm to the other. &ldquo;Say, but
you fellows are lucky chaps! Cutting out several
weeks of school, and going off hunting. I wish I
was you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget my turtles,&rdquo; pleaded Fenn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll attend to &rsquo;em, Stumpy,&rdquo; promised Sandy.
&ldquo;Bring me back a bear skin; will you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If we get enough for ourselves we will,&rdquo; agreed
Bart, and Sandy went on to school, looking back at
the chums with envious eyes, for, as has been explained,
the campers left about a week before the
Christmas holidays began.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, maybe we&rsquo;ll have a good time&mdash;I mean of
<i>course</i> we will,&rdquo; said Frank, &ldquo;but, all the same,
Sandy is better off than we are&mdash;in one respect.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo; asked Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He isn&rsquo;t under suspicion of having stolen a valuable
diamond bracelet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. Hang it all! I wish we could clear
that thing up,&rdquo; remarked Bart, with energy.
&ldquo;Never mind, maybe it will clear itself up before we
get back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whoa!&rdquo; called Jed, suddenly, pulling up his
team.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; asked Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The nigh horse jest stumbled with its left fore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
foot,&rdquo; explained the driver, as he got out of the sled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hurt?&rdquo; inquired Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, but it&rsquo;s a sign of bad luck, and I don&rsquo;t like
it, especially when you fellows are going off on a
pleasure trip.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you going to do?&rdquo; Frank wanted to
know, for Jed was kicking away the snow in front
of the horses.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m looking for a black stone,&rdquo; he explained.
&ldquo;If you can find a black stone, after a horse stumbles
like that, it&rsquo;s all right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boys wanted to laugh at the almost childish
superstition exhibited by Jed, but did not want to
make him feel bad, so they managed to keep sober
faces, as he kicked about in the small drifts. Finally
he uttered a triumphant cry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve found it!&rdquo; he announced, as he pocketed a
small black stone. &ldquo;Now it will be all right. Gid-dap,
ponies,&rdquo; and the horses started off again, utterly
indifferent to signs of all kinds.</p>

<p>The four chums talked of nothing but camp on the
way to the station, and, as for Jed, he was so occupied
in watching for signs and omens, good and
bad, that he was not a brilliant conversationalist.
Just as they approached the depot the driver pulled
sharply to the right, turned out of the main road,
and urged his horses in a circle around the standpipe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
of the water tank that supplied the locomotive
tenders. Then he swung the team up to the platform.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why did you do that?&rdquo; asked Ned, in curiosity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For good luck,&rdquo; replied Jed. &ldquo;Nothing better
for good luck than going around in a circle just before
you start off on a journey. It&rsquo;s sure to bring
you back safe, and I want to see you lads again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you make it out that a circle will bring
any one back safe?&rdquo; inquired Frank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because, it stands to reason, don&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; asked
Jed, with conviction. &ldquo;A circle&rsquo;s round, ain&rsquo;t it?
Very well, bein&rsquo; round it hasn&rsquo;t got any end, nor
yet any beginnin&rsquo;. That means you&rsquo;ve got to come
back to the place where you started. I know a circle
always brings good luck when you&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; on a
journey. I know it for sure. Once I went over to
Hampton Junction without goin&rsquo; around in a circle
before I started. What was the result? A feller
stole my pocketbook that had a dollar an&rsquo; nineteen
cents in it. Don&rsquo;t tell me there&rsquo;s nothing in signs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boys laughed, and Jed did not seem to mind.
They leaped out on the station platform, and paid
the teamster, who wished them all sorts of good
luck, in addition to having worked the &ldquo;circle degree&rdquo;
on them, as Ned expressed it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here!&rdquo; exclaimed Jed suddenly, as the chums<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
were about to go and purchase their tickets, and he
held out a black object to Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; inquired the lad.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That black, lucky stone I picked up when the
horse stumbled. Take it along. It will keep you
from having an accident, Bart.&rdquo; The youth was
about to refuse, but not wishing to hurt Jed&rsquo;s feelings
he put the rock in his pocket.</p>

<p>A little later the train pulled in, and, getting
aboard, the four chums waved a farewell to Jed, who
could be observed standing up in his sled, making
some queer signs, evidently with the idea of bringing
more good luck.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;re off at last,&rdquo; remarked Ned, as the
train gathered speed, &ldquo;and some of Jed&rsquo;s signs seem
to be coming true.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you make that out?&rdquo; asked Frank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to clear,&rdquo; replied Ned, with a look at
the sky. &ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t mind snow, after we&rsquo;ve got our
camp established, but it&rsquo;s no fun to set up tents in a
storm, so I&rsquo;m glad it&rsquo;s going to clear. Jed&rsquo;s signs
are all right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was a ride of several hours to Cannistota, and
the boys beguiled the time as best they could. About
noon, when the train was passing through a lonely
mountainous region, where the woods were as dense
as if they had never been cut, Frank remarked:</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, what do you say to lunch? It&rsquo;s about
time,&rdquo; for they had brought along a goodly supply
of food, as they could get no meals on the train.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m with you,&rdquo; announced Bart, as he reached up
to the rack over the seats for the baskets. He was
standing on his tip-toes, for the rack was high, and
was just taking down one of the small hampers,
when there came a sudden crash, followed by a ripping,
tearing sound, and before Bart knew what had
happened he was deposited in a heap on top of Fenn,
who, in turn, was mixed up with Frank and Ned.</p>

<p>Bart lay stunned for a few seconds and then, as he
picked himself up, and the other lads regained their
feet, they saw that every passenger in the car had
been hurled from his or her seat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What happened?&rdquo; cried Bart.</p>

<p>At the same moment from the car in which were
the four chums, as well as from the other coaches,
there arose the shrill screams of women, and the
crying of children. The train had rolled on for a
few feet, after the crash, but had come to a sudden
stop.</p>

<p>&ldquo;An accident!&rdquo; cried Fenn. &ldquo;The train&rsquo;s wrecked!
Come on, let&rsquo;s get out,&rdquo; and he scrambled to his feet
and started for the door as the conductor and a
brakeman ran through the car toward the engine.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI"></a>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<h3>PUTTING UP THE TENTS</h3>


<p>After the first paralyzing shock of the crash the
passengers seemed to come to their senses. Women
who had been screaming ceased, and children
stopped their frightened crying. Men began to
gather themselves together, to crawl out from under
seats where the sudden stop had thrown them, and
prepared to leave the car.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, conductor?&rdquo; called Bart to
that official, as he was hurrying out of the car.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know&mdash;yet,&rdquo; was the answer flung back
over his shoulder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go see,&rdquo; spoke Ned. &ldquo;Anyhow, our car&rsquo;s
not smashed; that&rsquo;s one good thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, and it doesn&rsquo;t seem to have left the track,&rdquo;
observed Frank. &ldquo;Maybe we only hit an obstruction.&rdquo;</p>

<p>By this time the four chums were out of their
car, and they were followed by a number of men
passengers. From other cars a like stream was
pouring.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>One glance sufficed to show that whatever the
wreck was, it was not a terrible one, for there were
no telescoped coaches, and, in fact, none seemed to
have left the rails, while as for the engine that, too,
seemed to be in its usual place at the head of the
coaches. The crowd was moving toward the forward
end, and thither Bart and his companions went.
Matters were becoming quiet, and it was evident that
no one was seriously hurt.</p>

<p>The boys found quite a throng around the engine,
and they could now see that the cab, on one side, was
splintered, and that the forward end of the coach
next to the engine, which was the baggage car, was
also damaged.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter? What happened?&rdquo; scores of
voices asked the railroad men, who, including the
fireman and engineer, were examining the locomotive.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Driving rod broke,&rdquo; explained the conductor.
&ldquo;It threshed around like a flail, and smashed the
cab, on the fireman&rsquo;s side of the engine. Luckily he
was putting on coal, or he&rsquo;d been killed. Then the
engineer threw on the emergency brake, and the
front end of the baggage car crumpled up. Luckily
it&rsquo;s no worse. Has any one heard of any persons being
hurt?&rdquo; the conductor asked the crowd.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess bruises and cuts from broken windows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
will be about the extent of the injuries, conductor,&rdquo;
replied a fat man. &ldquo;But how long are we likely to
be delayed here? I have an important engagement
in Vailton to-day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to wait until we can telegraph for another
engine,&rdquo; replied the railroad man. &ldquo;It will
take several hours, I&rsquo;m afraid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There were some expressions of dismay, but, in
general, the crowd was thankful that it was no
worse. The engineer and fireman were busy trying
to get the bent driving rod loose from where it had
jammed up somewhere in the interior of the locomotive.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go back in our car, and look after our
things,&rdquo; proposed Bart. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t do any good
here, and it&rsquo;s cold,&rdquo; for they had rushed out without
their overcoats. The other passengers were returning
to their coaches by this time, leaving the
problem of moving the train with the railroad men.</p>

<p>The four chums had been in their seats but a
short time, having found their possessions somewhat
scattered, but safe, when a brakeman came hurrying
in. He hastened to the glass-fronted toolbox,
fastened near the ceiling in the center of the car.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to get out that sledge-hammer, axe and
saw,&rdquo; he explained to a woman, who was sitting in
the seat under the case. &ldquo;May I ask you to move,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
madam?&rdquo; She did so, and then the brakeman was
in a quandary, for it was necessary to break the
glass in order to get at the tools. The trainman
looked about helplessly, for he had not been on the
road long. Bart saw his difficulty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here, I&rsquo;ll break the glass,&rdquo; volunteered the lad.
&ldquo;Stand back,&rdquo; Bart produced the black, lucky stone
which Jed had given him, and threw it through the
glass front.</p>

<p>There was a crashing, splintering sound, and the
glass was in fragments. The brakeman could get
at the tools, which he quickly did, hurrying out with
them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, that lucky stone came in handy, after all,&rdquo;
remarked Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It sure did,&rdquo; agreed Bart, &ldquo;though he could have
used the end of a flag stick just as well, if he had
thought of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>While the engineer, firemen, and some of the
brakemen worked over the disabled engine, another
trainman walked back to the nearest telegraph office
to summon a relief engine. Meanwhile the passengers
waited with what patience they could.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, suppose we eat now,&rdquo; proposed Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; exclaimed Frank. &ldquo;Pass out the sandwiches,&rdquo;
which Bart proceeded to do.</p>

<p>In the seat across the aisle from the boys was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
little girl. Hungrily she eyed the food as it came
out of the baskets, and, in a voice that could be
heard from one end of the car to the other, she piped
out:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mamma, I&rsquo;m hungry. Why didn&rsquo;t we bring
some lunch?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hush, dear,&rdquo; said the child&rsquo;s mother. &ldquo;We will
soon be at our station, and we can get something to
eat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not very likely to be there soon, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; observed
the fat man, who was in a hurry. &ldquo;By Jove,
I wish I&rsquo;d thought to bring a snack. I will, next
time I travel on this road.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, mamma, I&rsquo;m awful hungry,&rdquo; insisted the
child, as she gazed eagerly at the chums who were
munching away in great enjoyment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; begged the mother, but the child repeated
her request for something to eat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; spoke Bart, suddenly, and passed over a
chicken sandwich to the little girl. &ldquo;Will you let
her take it?&rdquo; he asked the mother.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly, but I&rsquo;m afraid it will be robbing you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not at all, we have plenty. Perhaps you&rsquo;d like
one too?&rdquo; and Bart handed the woman one, which
she received with thanks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you a dollar for two sandwiches, young
man,&rdquo; said the fat man, eagerly.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>Bart hesitated. At the same time several other
children in the car, seeing the girl eating, began to
demand food.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I say, fellows,&rdquo; said Bart, quickly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you
what&rsquo;s let&rsquo;s do! We&rsquo;ll distribute our lunch among
the youngsters on the train. There must be several
of them, and they&rsquo;re all hungry. It will be some
time before they can get to where there&rsquo;s lunch.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To the credit of the Darewell Chums be it said
that they did not hesitate a moment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go ahead,&rdquo; exclaimed Ned, and the others
nodded assent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish you&rsquo;d accept my offer before you came
to that conclusion,&rdquo; sighed the fat man. &ldquo;But go
ahead. The kids will be glad to get it. I&rsquo;ll have to
dine off chocolate caramels, I guess.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bart&rsquo;s plan was soon in operation, to the delight
of a number of boys and girls, no less than their
distracted mothers. As for the chums, they had
each eaten a sandwich before giving away their
lunch, and they thought they could stand it until
they got to Cannistota. They were given an informal
vote of thanks by the grateful parents.</p>

<p>Then ensued tedious waiting until the relief engine
came. There were many murmurs, and much
fault-finding, but there was no help for it. The
candy boy sold out his stock of sweet stuff in record<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
time, even down to the chewing gum. At length a
welcome whistle was heard, and soon the train was
under way again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; remarked Ned, as he settled back in his
seat, &ldquo;we will enjoy our supper, anyhow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; remarked Bart. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t altogether believe
in Jed&rsquo;s good luck signs. I&rsquo;d just as soon he
would have omitted some of &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, we&rsquo;ll be in camp to-morrow,&rdquo; announced
Frank. &ldquo;Then we can eat whenever we feel
like it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The chums were late in arriving in Cannistota, and
they went at once to a hotel. They had arranged
to do this anyhow, as they knew there would not
be time to put up tents the same day that they started
off on their camping trip. After a substantial meal,
to make up for their light dinner, they inquired at
the express office, and learned that their camp stuff
had arrived safely. They arranged for a teamster
to take it to the woods where they had decided to
pitch their tents, and early the next morning they
were under way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a dandy day,&rdquo; observed Fenn, as he looked
at the cloudless sky overhead, and saw the piles of
snow on every side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A little too warm,&rdquo; was Bart&rsquo;s opinion. &ldquo;Still,
it may not be thawing so much in the woods. I&rsquo;m<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
anxious to get a shot at something. We can&rsquo;t hunt
deer, you know, when there&rsquo;s tracking snow, but I
hear there are bears where we are going.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A feller I know killed a big one last week, not
a great ways from where you&rsquo;re going,&rdquo; observed
the teamster.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the stuff!&rdquo; cried Bart, as he looked to
make sure he had his favorite rifle.</p>

<p>In due time the camping site was reached, the
teamster helped them unload, and then drove back,
leaving the four chums alone in quite a lonely stretch
of wilderness. But they were used to depending on
themselves, they knew they had plenty of food, and
they hoped to procure more with their guns.</p>

<p>&ldquo;First thing on the programme is to make the
camp-fire, and then set up the tents,&rdquo; declared Bart,
who constituted himself a sort of leader.</p>

<p>Previous experience stood the boys in good stead,
and in a short time a roaring fire was blazing, and
a kettle of soup in the making was suspended over
it. Then the canvas shelters were put up.</p>

<p>It was not easy work, and the boys labored hard,
but at last the white tent stood among the trees, making
a picturesque spot in the wilderness. Then the
cooking shelter was put up, and the stove set, after
which Fenn, who constituted himself cook on this
occasion, served dinner.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>The rest of the day was spent in cutting firewood,
seeing to the fastenings of the tents, putting up cots,
arranging their baggage and food supplies, and in
putting together their shot guns and rifles, for each
lad had two weapons.</p>

<p>By this time it was nearly night-fall, and some
lanterns were lighted, and hung within and without
the tent, giving the place a cheerful look.</p>

<p>As Fenn was walking about, getting ready for a
late supper, he stumbled over something, and nearly
fell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that, a tree root?&rdquo; asked Bart. &ldquo;If it is,
chop it out, or we&rsquo;ll all be doing the same thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t a tree root,&rdquo; observed Fenn, as he
turned to examine the object. &ldquo;By cracky, boys!&rdquo;
he exclaimed. &ldquo;Look here! It&rsquo;s a whopping big
mud turtle!&rdquo;</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII"></a>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<h3>THE PLACE OF THE TURTLES</h3>


<p>Fenn&rsquo;s chums hurried over to where, in the
gleam of a lantern, he was contemplating the slow-moving
reptile. The turtle was a large one, of a
common species, and was ambling along as if it did
not at all mind the attention it had attracted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Grab it, Fenn!&rdquo; exclaimed Ned. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be a
dandy for your collection.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what it will,&rdquo; agreed the stout youth, and
he grabbed up the turtle, which at once drew in its
tail, head and claws, presenting no vantage spot to
an enemy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By Caesar, here&rsquo;s another!&rdquo; exclaimed Bart, a
moment later. &ldquo;Another turtle, Fenn!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and here&rsquo;s a third one!&rdquo; added Frank. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
a big one, too, Fenn. Shall I catch it for you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait a minute, fellows,&rdquo; replied Fenn, earnestly.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t touch those turtles!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; asked Ned. &ldquo;Are they poisonous?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, but there&rsquo;s something queer about so many
being out in the woods in the middle of winter. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
isn&rsquo;t natural. There is something out of the ordinary,
and we must see what it is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe they&rsquo;re hunting for the one of their number
who wears the diamond bracelet,&rdquo; suggested
Bart, with a laugh, for, in spite of the gravity of
the loss, he could not forbear an occasional joke at
Fenn&rsquo;s rather odd theory.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, it isn&rsquo;t that,&rdquo; went on Fenn earnestly. &ldquo;But
I did have a notion that perhaps the turtles might
have escaped from the queer man who wrote and
offered to buy my collection&mdash;the man we suspect of
stealing the bracelet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why he isn&rsquo;t in this vicinity,&rdquo; remarked Frank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know whether he is or not,&rdquo; was
Fenn&rsquo;s answer. &ldquo;This seems to be a good place for
turtles, though I can&rsquo;t understand why they should
be out in cold weather. But perhaps there is some
reason for it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was, and a strange one, as the boys soon
discovered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anyhow, they&rsquo;re here,&rdquo; observed Ned, &ldquo;and
what are we going to do about it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t touch &rsquo;em, I want to see in what direction
they are traveling,&rdquo; called Fenn, who, as soon as
he had placed in a safe place the turtle he had
caught, came over to where his chums were contemplating
the other two.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re both heading for the same place, wherever
that is, if that&rsquo;s any help to you,&rdquo; remarked
Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; spoke Fenn, &ldquo;it may indicate something,&rdquo;
and he looked at the big reptiles, who were crawling
along.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re going in the same way as the one was
you got,&rdquo; declared Frank, and the others confirmed
this.</p>

<p>For some minutes Fenn observed the movements
of the turtles, until they disappeared under some
bushes. Then he straightened up and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t believe that mysterious man is in
this vicinity, and certainly none of these turtles is
wearing a diamond bracelet. I admit I&rsquo;m away off
on that, fellows. But there&rsquo;s something queer here,
and I&rsquo;m going to get at the bottom of it. It isn&rsquo;t
natural for turtles to be out so plentiful this time of
year, and there must be some cause for it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fenn, you can theorize about turtles all you like,
but I want my supper,&rdquo; called Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Same here,&rdquo; came from Frank. &ldquo;Dish it up,
cook!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thereupon Fenn gave over watching the turtles,
and, a little later, seated cozily in the tent, the chums
partook of a supper of canned baked beans, with
hard-tack or pilot biscuit, and coffee. Then they sat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
around, discussing various matters, from the railroad
accident to their arrival in camp.</p>

<p>Cots were provided, with plenty of blankets, so
they would not suffer from cold, and as an additional
precaution a small fire was kept going in the
small, sheet-iron, wood-burning stove, which they
had brought along to warm the sleeping tent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, fellows, this is something like life,&rdquo; remarked
Bart, as he arranged himself on his cot.
&ldquo;Listen to the wind howling outside. We&rsquo;ll have
more snow, I expect, before morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let it snow!&rdquo; exclaimed Frank. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re all
right now. We&rsquo;ll have to have our Christmas tree
here, fellows. Did you bring anything along to put
on it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;ll hang up our stockings instead of having
a tree,&rdquo; suggested Ned with a laugh. &ldquo;But
what&rsquo;s the matter with you, Fenn? Why are you so
quiet?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s thinking of some of the girls he left behind
him,&rdquo; mocked Bart. &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you, Stumpy? Which
particular one last gave you a lock of her hair?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, cut it out!&rdquo; begged Fenn. &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t thinking
of such nonsense at all. I was wondering where
those turtles came from. This is a regular stamping
place for them, and in the morning I&rsquo;m going to go
on a search.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you really think so many of them around
here means anything?&rdquo; asked Frank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It means something, certainly,&rdquo; replied Fenn.
&ldquo;This part of the State is noted for turtles, however,
there being a number of different species, but I never
knew before that they came out in winter. That&rsquo;s
what puzzles me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe we&rsquo;re over a hidden volcano, and it&rsquo;s
warmer than anywhere else in the neighborhood,&rdquo;
suggested Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; assented Fenn, &ldquo;only it doesn&rsquo;t seem
very warm just now. There&rsquo;s a draught somewhere.
Bur-r-r-r! No wonder!&rdquo; he exclaimed.
&ldquo;The tent flap has come open. Who fastened it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did,&rdquo; confessed Frank. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll fix it.&rdquo; The canvas
was soon made secure, and then, while the wind
whipped itself into a gale outside, the boys fell
asleep in their warm tent, Fenn&rsquo;s last thoughts being
about a place where he had seen the three turtles.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII"></a>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<h3>THE MUD VOLCANO</h3>


<p>Bart&rsquo;s first act, on awakening in the morning,
was to go to the tent flap, and look out. Then he
called to his companions, who were still asleep:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say fellows, it&rsquo;s a fine day; only it&rsquo;s snowing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you wake us up to tell us that?&rdquo; demanded
Ned, as he turned over for another nap.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you don&rsquo;t want to sleep all day, do you?&rdquo;
asked Bart, looking at his watch. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s eight o&rsquo;clock.
If we&rsquo;re going to do any hunting we&rsquo;d better get a
move on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was much yawning and stretching, but
finally the chums were up and dressed, and breakfast
was served.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now for a nice lot of game,&rdquo; exclaimed Bart, as
he got out his rifle, and looked over his supply of ammunition.
&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll load for bear to-day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you mean to say you expect to go shooting
in this storm?&rdquo; asked Frank, for it was still snowing.
The white flakes were of a considerable depth
on the ground, but the two tents, standing as they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
did under some gigantic pine trees, were much protected.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course we&rsquo;re going hunting to-day,&rdquo; declared
Bart. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what we came for. Some bear steak
wouldn&rsquo;t go at all bad, especially as we can&rsquo;t get
fresh meat here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, nor fresh bread, either,&rdquo; added Ned. &ldquo;I
miss my rolls with my coffee.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to bake some biscuits for dinner,&rdquo; declared
Fenn. &ldquo;I brought along some self-raising
flour.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good for you, Stumpy!&rdquo; cried Ned. &ldquo;Pity,
though, you didn&rsquo;t bring along some self-baking
bread, and some washless dishes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, if we&rsquo;re going, let&rsquo;s go,&rdquo; proposed Frank.
&ldquo;Will it be safe to leave our stuff in camp, unprotected?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t take it with us,&rdquo; said Bart. &ldquo;Besides,
there isn&rsquo;t any one within ten miles of this place.
That&rsquo;s why I wanted to camp here. It will be all
right. Well, I&rsquo;m ready if you are.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to take my shot-gun,&rdquo; decided Frank.
&ldquo;Maybe I&rsquo;ll see some wild turkeys or some partridge.
They&rsquo;ll do if Bart doesn&rsquo;t get his bear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fenn, instead of getting ready his gun, as the
others were going, had gone to the box where he had
placed the large turtle, captured the night previous.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;For cats&rsquo; sake!&rdquo; exclaimed Ned, &ldquo;aren&rsquo;t you
done playing with that yet, Fenn?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not playing,&rdquo; was the retort. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to
try an experiment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you going hunting with us?&rdquo; asked Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not this morning. I&rsquo;m going to solve this mystery
of the turtles, if I can. Besides you fellows will
shoot all that&rsquo;s necessary. I&rsquo;ll stay around here,
and get ready for a partridge pot-pie or a bear roast,
just as you prefer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, come on hunting,&rdquo; pleaded Bart. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s
the fun in staying here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know as I shall stay right in camp,&rdquo;
went on Fenn. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to make this turtle lead
me to where the other ones went. In other words,
I&rsquo;m going to use this one as a guide.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re crazy!&rdquo; scoffed Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; admitted Fenn, calmly. &ldquo;You fellows
go on with your hunting, and when you come back
maybe I&rsquo;ll have something to show you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They tried to induce Fenn to accompany them, but
he was firm in his determination to solve the &ldquo;turtle
mystery,&rdquo; as he called it, and, in the end, Bart, Ned
and Frank tramped off through the storm, for it
was still snowing, while the stout lad remained behind,
watching the turtle, which he had placed on
a cleared place on the ground in front of the tent.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Now go ahead, my fine fellow,&rdquo; spoke Fenn to
the reptile. &ldquo;Which way do you want to head?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The turtle seemed undecided about it, for some
time after Fenn had placed it on the ground it did
not move, but remained with head, legs and tail withdrawn
into the protecting shell. But Fenn was patient,
and knew better than to poke the reptile to
make it move. Presently a long, snake-like neck
was thrust out, and black, beady eyes glanced cautiously
around, while the parrot jaws were slightly
parted, as if to ward off any attack.</p>

<p>Fenn kept behind the turtle, which, in a few
minutes, finding that it was not disturbed, stuck out
its legs, and began to raise itself up, as if taking an
observation. Then it turned partly around, and, to
Fenn&rsquo;s delight, started to crawl in the same direction
as that taken by the other two reptiles the previous
evening.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the stuff!&rdquo; cried Fenn. &ldquo;That confirms
my theory. There&rsquo;s some place where these turtles
hang out, and I&rsquo;m going to find it. The three we
found must have wandered away from the common
camping ground of the turtles of this vicinity, but
they all head back toward it. Now I&rsquo;m going to
find it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He did not wait for the reptile he had captured
to lead him to the place. That would have taken too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
long, but, after quickly scratching his initials on the
back of the turtle&rsquo;s shell, together with the date, so
he would know the reptile again, Fenn replaced it
on the ground, and started off through the woods
in the indicated direction. He had his gun with him,
but he did not expect to do any shooting, and he
carried a pocket compass, for the woods were unfamiliar
to him.</p>

<p>For a long distance Fenn tramped on, plowing
through the woods, making turns now and then to
avoid streams, partly frozen over, leaping them
when he could, fording them at other times, for he
had on high, water-proof hunting boots, but keeping
as nearly as he could in the proper course.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe I&rsquo;ll find a well-protected cave, where the
turtles live during winter,&rdquo; thought the stout lad, as
he made his way under some low hemlock trees,
well laden with a blanket of snow. &ldquo;If I do, I can get
some new specimens, anyhow, and perhaps enough
to sell to that man who wrote me the letter. Mighty
queer about him. I wonder who he was? I wonder
if, by any possibility, he could be up here in these
woods?&rdquo;</p>

<p>This idea caused Fenn to look around somewhat
apprehensively, but there was no one in sight. He
did see something, however, that caused his heart<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
to beat faster, and this was a brace of plump partridges
on a tree, not far away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder if I can shoot straight enough to bag
them?&rdquo; murmured the lad, as he quickly raised his
gun, and banged away, first with the left, and then
with the right barrel. Somewhat to his surprise
when the smoke cleared away, Fenn saw the two
birds lying in the snow. He had made a good shot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, we won&rsquo;t go hungry to-night, anyway,&rdquo;
was his comment, as he picked them up and put them
in the pockets of his hunting coat. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m going
to keep on,&rdquo; he added.</p>

<p>He had gone perhaps half a mile farther, when he
suddenly stopped and sniffed the air suspiciously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sulphur spring,&rdquo; he remarked, half aloud.
&ldquo;Guess I&rsquo;ll go take a look at it. Whew! It&rsquo;s strong
enough. I don&rsquo;t need any other guide than my
nose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Making sure of the direction in which the strong
odor of sulphur was wafted to him, Fenn temporarily
abandoned his quest for the place of the turtles.
The odor grew more pronounced, for some sulphur
springs are so strongly impregnated with that chemical
in solution that the smell carries for miles, especially
on a windy day. The region where the chums
had gone camping, as they learned later, was well
supplied with these freaks of nature.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>A few minutes later Fenn had come upon the object
of his search. The spring gushed out from the
side of a hill, and so strong was the sulphur that the
stones, over which the spring, and the stream resulting
from it, flowed were a yellowish white.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whew!&rdquo; exclaimed Fenn again. &ldquo;This ought
to be good for whatever ails you, but I don&rsquo;t like
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He remained looking at the spring for a few
minutes, and, as he was about to move away he
was startled by a deep, booming sound in the woods,
off to his left. Fenn started.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Blasting?&rdquo; he exclaimed aloud, in a questioning
tone. &ldquo;No, it can&rsquo;t be that, either,&rdquo; he added.
&ldquo;They wouldn&rsquo;t be blasting around here!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The next moment he heard a pattering around
him, and several large globules of mud came down,
seemingly from the sky. Some struck on his hands,
and others dotted the white snow about him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s queer,&rdquo; murmured the lad. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s raining
mud&mdash;or else&mdash;&rdquo; he paused a moment, as the remembrance
of the booming sound returned to him.
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;there must be a spouting, boiling
spring around here. That&rsquo;s what it is! I&rsquo;m on the
track of it now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fenn dashed off to the left, through the forest.
He was eager to see what had caused the curious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
shower of mud. In a few minutes he came to a
little clearing in the woods&mdash;a clearing remarkable,
among other things, from the fact that the ground
there was devoid of snow. There was a warm,
damp look about it, too, as when, in a snow storm,
the sidewalk over a bakery oven is devoid of the
white flakes.</p>

<p>But that was not the most curious thing that met
Fenn&rsquo;s eyes. He made out numerous mud turtles
crawling about over the patch of ground that was
free from snow. There must have been a score of
the reptiles.</p>

<p>Then, as Fenn looked, a curious thing happened.
He had just noted that, in the centre of the clearing,
there was a large patch of water, and, a moment
later the middle of this spring seemed to lift itself
bodily up. Up and up the water spouted, and in an
instant its comparative purity was changed to a deep
mud color, as a miniature geyser of earth and liquid
shot upward.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A mud volcano!&rdquo; exclaimed Fenn, as he understood
what the phenomenon was. &ldquo;A mud volcano!
This explains the mystery of the turtles!&rdquo;</p>

<p>An instant later he was under a shower of mud
from the boiling spring.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV"></a>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<h3>BART&rsquo;S FIRST SHOT</h3>


<p>Fenn made a dash for the shelter of a spruce tree,
and watched the descending shower of mud and
water. It was soon over, and he stepped out again,
to view the curious volcano. He crossed the open
space, free from snow, and a number of turtles
scurried away at his advance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s how it is,&rdquo; remarked the lad, &ldquo;that the
turtles are so numerous around here. It&rsquo;s as warm
as toast around that mud volcano, and they don&rsquo;t
have to hibernate. The ones we found near our
camp must have wandered away in search of food,
and were on their way back here. I&rsquo;ve solved part
of the mystery, anyhow. Now to examine this curious
place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boiling spring, or mud volcano, as such phenomenons
are variously called, consisted, in the
main, of a large pool of muddy colored water, lying
at the foot of a hill. All around it were dead trees,
and the smell of sulphur, though not so strong as at
the first spring Fenn had visited, was plainly noticeable.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
The water had a dead, stagnant look, after the
eruption, and Fenn was careful not to approach too
close, for he could not tell when the spring would
spout up again. He saw a number of turtles on logs
and bits of wood that extended out into the pool, and
others plunged from the bank into the water at his
approach.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They don&rsquo;t seem to mind the sulphur and the
mud,&rdquo; said Fenn to himself. The lad had read in
his school books of the mud volcanoes. They are
of a type similar to the hot geysers of Yellowstone
Park, though not so large or numerous. Though
called boiling springs in some parts of the country
they do not boil or bubble on the surface, as a rule,
though there is a constant supply of warm water
from some subterranean source, so, that, as in the
case with the spring Fenn was viewing, the water
ran over from the pool, and trickled off through the
woods.</p>

<p>Mud volcanoes or boiling springs, while not common,
are to be met with in New York and Pennsylvania.
The writer recently visited a large one in
New York State, near Lake Ontario. It was around
Christmas, and a cold blustering day, yet the water
from the spring was quite warm, and had melted
the snow for quite a distance in all directions. The
water was impregnated with sulphur and salt, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
though there was not an eruption when the writer
was present, there were marks on surrounding trees
showing where mud had been hurled to a height of
thirty or forty feet.</p>

<p>There are various theories to account for the action
of the mud volcanoes. One is that steam is
formed away below the surface, and, seeking an
outlet, throws the mud and water with it. Another
is that the force of water, flowing from some mountain
lake, by an underground passage, spouts up
through the boiling spring, being heated in some
manner in its passage.</p>

<p>But Fenn did not trouble himself much about
these theories as he looked at the curious spring. It
was a gloomy, lonesome place, and the presence of
so many turtles, some of them very large, added to
the uncanny aspect.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, there are turtles enough here to stock several
collections,&rdquo; murmured Fenn. &ldquo;Lots of different
kinds, too. I will take some home I guess.
Now if I had that mysterious man&rsquo;s address I&rsquo;d
send him word. This mud volcano will be a curious
thing to show the other fellows. I wonder how
warm the water is?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He approached, to thrust his hand into the edge
of the spring, when an ominous rumbling beneath
his feet warned him. He jumped away just in time,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
and, as he ran for the shelter of the trees, there was
another upheaval of mud, and he received a share
of it. He remained in the shelter until the spring
subsided, and then made his way back to camp.</p>

<p>His chums were there when he arrived, and something
in their looks prompted Fenn to ask:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, where&rsquo;s the bear steak, and the partridges
for roasting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No luck,&rdquo; declared Bart in disgust. &ldquo;Never saw
a bit of game! I guess we camped in the wrong
place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no we didn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; exclaimed Fenn in triumph,
as he produced the two plump birds from his pockets.
&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s what I got, besides bagging a boiling spring
for my morning&rsquo;s work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, where&rsquo;d you get those?&rdquo; asked Bart eagerly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come on, show us?&rdquo; begged Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Time enough,&rdquo; responded the stout lad. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
going to have dinner now, and then we&rsquo;ll have these
birds, roasted, for supper. There&rsquo;s more where they
came from. Now I&rsquo;ll tell you about the mud volcano,&rdquo;
which he did, graphically, so that his chums
were eager to go and see it. But they decided to
wait until the next day, and to have a good supper
of roast partridge that night. Fenn cooked his
game to perfection, and was given a hearty vote of
thanks.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>A visit to the mud volcano was made the next
day, and there were found to be more turtles than
on Fenn&rsquo;s visit. The volcano was observed in action,
much to the wonderment of the three lads, who
had never seen anything like it, and once Ned, who
was too venturesome, was caught under an unusually
large shower of mud.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, let&rsquo;s go hunting now,&rdquo; proposed Bart, after
a pause. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t had a decent shot since we came
to camp. I&rsquo;ve got to get that bear before I go back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They tramped off through the woods, their eyes
eager for a sight of game, large or small. Each one
had a compass, so that if they became separated they
could make their way back to camp, for the forest
was dense. The snow had ceased, and the weather
was clear and cold.</p>

<p>Fenn and Frank had shotguns, and elected to try
to bag some wild turkeys or partridges, so they went
off to one side, while Bart and Ned, with their rifles,
kept together.</p>

<p>Suddenly Bart, after an hour&rsquo;s tramping in the
woods, with never a sight of anything larger than
a rabbit, which he would not fire at, came to an
abrupt stop. Ned, who was right behind him, halted
also.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; he whispered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is that over there?&rdquo; asked Bart, also in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
whisper, and he pointed to a black object near some
bushes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A stump,&rdquo; replied Ned promptly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do stumps move?&rdquo; inquired Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well that one did, so it isn&rsquo;t a stump. I think
it&rsquo;s a bear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bart&rsquo;s opinion was unexpectedly confirmed the
next moment, for the animal turned and uttered a
loud &ldquo;woof!&rdquo; as it sniffed at the snow at the foot of
the bush, evidently in search of something to eat.</p>

<p>Bart dropped to one knee, and took quick aim. It
was his first shot since arriving at camp, and it was
one worthy of much care, for bears were none too
common to risk missing one.</p>

<p>The rifle cracked, but there was no cloud of
smoke, for Bart was using his new smokeless cartridges.
The lad pumped another bullet into the barrel,
and fired again, for the bear had not moved after
the first report.</p>

<p>Then, as the echoes of the rifle died away, the two
lads saw the animal quickly rear itself upon its hind
legs, and swing around in their direction.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV"></a>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<h3>FENN FALLS IN</h3>


<p>&ldquo;Shoot again, Bart!&rdquo; cried Ned. &ldquo;You missed
him!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bart had pumped another cartridge into place, but
before he could pull the trigger the bear staggered
a few paces toward him, and then fell in a convulsive
heap. There was no need to fire again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s dead!&rdquo; cried Bart, exultantly, as he leaped
forward. &ldquo;My first bear, though it did take two
shots to settle him.&rdquo; But as he saw a few minutes
later, when he examined his prize, the first bullet
would have done the work, had he waited long
enough, for it was in a vital spot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now to get him to camp,&rdquo; proposed Ned, when
he and his chum had sufficiently admired the dead
bear. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have enough fresh meat for a week.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; assented Bart. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see how we&rsquo;re going
to get him back.&rdquo; He raised the fore end of the
bear, by his paws, and grunted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter&mdash;heavy?&rdquo; asked Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Try it and see,&rdquo; advised Bart. Ned did so, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
grunted in his turn. The truth of the matter was
that the bear, though not of full size, was fat and
plump, and of greater weight than the boys expected.
Then, too, the weight was &ldquo;dead,&rdquo; which made it all
the more awkward to carry. Bart and Ned tried
again, by turns, and both together, but the bear was
too much for them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to get Fenn and Frank to help us,&rdquo;
said Bart and he fired his rifle three times, in quick
succession, and then, after a pause, twice, more
slowly&mdash;the prearranged call for assistance. Fenn
and Frank came running up a little later, fearing
that some accident had happened, and they were
much relieved when they found that their help was
wanted in transporting the bear.</p>

<p>At Fenn&rsquo;s suggestion a long pole was cut, the
bear&rsquo;s paws were tied together and the pole thrust
through them, and then, with two lads on either end
of the shaft, and Bruin swinging between, the journey
back to camp was safely made.</p>

<p>Bart insisted on skinning his prize, saying he was
going to make a rug of the hide, and the best portions
of the meat were cut off for future use. As it
was desired to allow the flesh to cool a bit before
using it, the campers prepared a meal of the food
they had in stock, reserving the bear steaks for
supper.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>The rest of the day was spent around camp, several
improvements being made, with a view of
rendering life more comfortable during their stay.
The bear steak, broiled with pieces of bacon stuck
on it, was voted most delicious, and Fenn ate so
much that he said it made him sleepy.</p>

<p>It grew much colder in the night, and before
morning there was a demand for more blankets on
the part of Frank and Ned. As there were no more,
Bart volunteered to get up and replenish the fire in
the stove, for it had died down.</p>

<p>As he was putting on more wood he suddenly
paused, and seemed to be listening. Then he quietly
went to the tent flap and peered out into the darkness,
illuminated by a lantern hanging from the
ridge pole.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; asked Ned. &ldquo;Did you see
another bear, Bart?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought I heard some one walking around,&rdquo;
was the answer. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s snowing again. I don&rsquo;t see
any one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He went back to bed, every one sleeping more in
comfort now that the tent was warmer. In the
morning, Bart was the first one up, and he opened
the tent flap. As he looked out, noting that the sun
was shining, though the weather was cold, the lad
uttered a cry of astonishment.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; asked Fenn, pausing in his
dressing operations.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some one <i>was</i> sneaking around last night!&rdquo; declared
Bart. &ldquo;See the footprints!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The campers rushed from the tent in various
stages of negligee, and stared at a track of human
footprints, clearly visible in the new-fallen snow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whoever it was he came close to our tent, and
was evidently going to look in, when I must have
frightened him off by getting up to put wood on the
fire,&rdquo; said Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who was it?&rdquo; asked Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; responded Bart, &ldquo;only
it was some one who evidently wanted to get away
unobserved. Look, you can trace where he came
out of the woods, approached our tent very cautiously,
and then, when I frightened him, he took
it on the run.&rdquo; This was easy to confirm by the
spaces between the footprints, for when the midnight
visitor had approached slowly and stealthily
the marks were comparatively close together, but
where he had run they were far apart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get dressed, and have a look around,&rdquo; said
Fenn. But though they searched for some time
they could not find the intruder, even if his footsteps
were plainly visible, leading off into the forest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get breakfast and trace him up,&rdquo; suggested<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
Frank. &ldquo;Might as well do that as anything
else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s look and see if he&rsquo;s taken anything,&rdquo; suggested
Fenn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No need to do that, Stumpy,&rdquo; was Bart&rsquo;s opinion.
&ldquo;You can tell by his tracks that he wasn&rsquo;t near
enough to our camp to have stolen anything. Even
the bear meat is safe,&rdquo; and he looked to where it
was suspended on a tree limb, by means of a long
rope, a precaution taken to keep it out of the way
of prowling animals.</p>

<p>With their guns in readiness for any game, the
four chums set out after breakfast on the trail of
the unknown, midnight visitor. The marks were
easy to follow, for very little snow had fallen after
Bart had replenished the wood in the stove.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, do you notice which way he&rsquo;s heading?&rdquo;
asked Fenn, excitedly, when they had gone on about
a mile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not particularly,&rdquo; said Frank. &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s gone to the mud volcano&mdash;that&rsquo;s where he&rsquo;s
gone, fellows!&rdquo; declared the stout youth. &ldquo;I wonder
what he wants there? Maybe he&rsquo;s after mud
turtles. Maybe he&rsquo;s the same man who wrote to
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He might be almost anybody, Stumpy,&rdquo; was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
Ned&rsquo;s opinion. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t tell until we see him.
Get a move on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The footsteps were becoming fainter now, for the
wind had drifted the snow across them in a number
of places, but they were sufficiently visible to indicate
that the man had kept on in the direction of the
boiling spring.</p>

<p>Just before the boys reached that phenomenon,
the marks vanished altogether, coming to an abrupt
stop in the snow, but it was evident that this was
due to the wind covering the tracks with white crystals
from the drifts, and not because the man had
mysteriously vanished.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, we may as well go on to the spring,&rdquo;
spoke Fenn. &ldquo;Maybe we&rsquo;ll find him there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the vicinity of the mud volcano was deserted,
though numerous mud turtles were crawling
about over the warm ground, which was devoid of
snow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going closer and have a look,&rdquo; decided
Fenn, as he started away from his chums.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Better be careful, Stumpy,&rdquo; warned Bart. &ldquo;It
doesn&rsquo;t look as if there had been an eruption lately,
and you may catch it all of a sudden.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll chance it,&rdquo; said the heavy-weight lad.</p>

<p>He walked close to the edge of the spring, which
was motionless save for the water that ran from it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
Fenn was looking for footprints in the soft ground,
but he and his chums had made so many on their
own account, on their previous visits to the place,
and, as they were still visible (for the ground had
not frozen), the amateur detective was at a loss.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There doesn&rsquo;t seem to be anything here,&rdquo; announced
Fenn, as he turned to come away. Hardly
had he spoken than he was seen to jump back. That
is, he tried to do so, but he was too late. An instant
later he was observed to throw up his hands and
slowly sink into the marshy ground on the edge
of the warm spring.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Help! Help!&rdquo; cried poor Fenn, as he felt himself
going down. &ldquo;Help, fellows!&rdquo;</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI"></a>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<h3>FRANK MAKES PANCAKES</h3>


<p>&ldquo;Fellows, he&rsquo;s fallen in a quicksand!&rdquo; yelled
Bart. &ldquo;Come on, help him out!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look out we don&rsquo;t get in it ourselves,&rdquo; cautioned
Frank, but it was from no desire to shirk any danger
in rescuing his chum that he was thus thoughtful.
Rather he wanted to be on the safe side. &ldquo;Go
ahead, Bart and Ned. I&rsquo;ll get some tree branches,
in case you can&rsquo;t reach him,&rdquo; he added.</p>

<p>Ned and Bart started on a run toward their unfortunate
chum. Poor Fenn was engulfed almost
to his shoulders, and was struggling ineffectually to
get out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, we&rsquo;ll save you!&rdquo; called Bart encouragingly.
&ldquo;Hold on, Stumpy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the trouble&mdash;there&rsquo;s nothing to hold on
to,&rdquo; panted Fenn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is the water hot?&rdquo; asked Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, only warm; but I&rsquo;m in as much mud as I
am water. Give me a hand, and pull me out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bart and Ned advanced to do so, but, to their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
dismay they found that they were themselves sinking
in. As they had approached on this side of the
boiling spring on a previous occasion, much closer
to the water than they now were, it was evident
that there had been a shifting of the earth underneath
the surface.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t come any closer, Stumpy,&rdquo; announced
Bart. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll sink in ourselves.&rdquo; He was about
to go back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t&mdash;don&rsquo;t leave me!&rdquo; begged the unfortunate
lad, making another attempt to lift himself out of
the slough. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go back on me, Bart!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t. We were only trying to think of
a way to get you out,&rdquo; answered Bart, as he held
Ned back from going too close.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here, this will do it,&rdquo; cried Frank, running up
at that moment with a long, tree branch. &ldquo;Take
hold of this, Stumpy, and we&rsquo;ll haul you out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Standing where the ground was firm, Frank
thrust forward the branch, Bart and Ned assisting
their chum. Fenn grasped desperately at the other
end, and his three companions braced themselves.</p>

<p>There was a straining, a long, steady pull and
Fenn slowly began to emerge from the hole. Once
he was started it was an easy matter to pull him out
completely, and in a few seconds he was out of danger,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
and standing beside his chums on solid earth.
But such a sight!</p>

<p>He was covered with mud almost from his head
to his feet. It dripped from his clothes, and his
hands were thick with it, while some had even
splashed on his face. He had not been rescued
more than a minute before there came a rumbling
sound, and a spray of mud and water shot up into
the air. The volcano was in eruption, and Fenn had
been saved in the nick of time, for the place where
he had been sucked down was right on the edge of
the disturbance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How did it happen?&rdquo; asked Frank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was so quick I can&rsquo;t tell,&rdquo; answered the muddy
lad. &ldquo;All I know is that I went down and seemed
to keep on going.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Better come over to where the water flows out
of the spring, and wash off,&rdquo; suggested Ned, and
Fenn agreed with him. The water with which he
removed the worst of the mud from his clothes was
unpleasant smelling, impregnated as it was with
salt and sulphur, but there was no help for it. As
the three labored to get Fenn into some sort of presentable
shape, numerous turtles crawled around
them, evidently disturbed by the unaccustomed visits.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll do, I guess,&rdquo; remarked Fenn, at
length, trying to catch a glimpse of himself in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
little stream of water. &ldquo;Wow, but that&rsquo;s dirty mud,
though!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Next time don&rsquo;t go so near,&rdquo; cautioned Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You should have told me that first,&rdquo; answered
Fenn, with a grim smile.</p>

<p>With a final look at the place of the mud volcano
the boys turned back toward camp. They had not
learned much, save that the mysterious visitor had
come in the direction of the boiling spring&mdash;why,
they could not fathom. Fenn spoke of getting
some of the less common turtles to add to his collection,
but his chums persuaded him to wait until
they were ready to go home.</p>

<p>Fenn&rsquo;s first work, when he reached the tent, was
to change his clothes, and then, making a good fire
in the wood stove he took a bath, with water melted
from snow. He felt better after this, and was about
to proceed with the getting ready of supper, for
they had taken their lunch with them on their tramp
to the spring, and had made coffee on the way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fenn, you sit down and rest, and I&rsquo;ll get the
meal,&rdquo; suggested Frank, good-naturedly. &ldquo;I think
I&rsquo;ll give you fellows a treat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;ll it be?&rdquo; asked Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How would pancakes go?&rdquo; inquired Frank with
a triumphant air.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you make &rsquo;em?&rdquo; asked Bart, doubtfully.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure. I did it at home once; for dad and me.
We have some prepared flour here, and the directions
are on the package. You fellows go outside,
and when the cakes are ready I&rsquo;ll call you in to
supper.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That suits me,&rdquo; observed Bart, and the others
assented joyfully. Leaving Frank in the cook-tent,
they busied themselves about various things, awaiting
the call for supper, and with no great amount
of patience, for they were hungry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you fellows smell anything,&rdquo; asked Bart,
after a long wait, and he sniffed the air strongly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean to say Frank&rsquo;s burning those
cakes, do you?&rdquo; inquired Ned anxiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t smell him cooking them at all,&rdquo; answered
Bart. &ldquo;They ought to be pretty nearly done
by this time, for it doesn&rsquo;t take long. Maybe he&rsquo;s
in trouble. I&rsquo;m going to take a look.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He advanced cautiously to peer into the cook tent,
whence came a series of rather queer sounds. Bart
took one look through the flap, and then beckoned
to his chums.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look, but don&rsquo;t laugh,&rdquo; he cautioned them.</p>

<p>It was well he did, for the sight that met their
eyes made them want to howl. Frank was in the
midst of the tent, surrounded by several pots, pans,
pails, dishes and other receptacles, filled with pancake<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
batter. He was industriously stirring more in
the bread-pan, and there was a puzzled look on
his face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hang it all,&rdquo; Frank&rsquo;s chums heard him mutter,
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t seem to get this stuff right. Guess it needs
more flour.&rdquo; He put some into the batter he was
mixing, and then stirred it. &ldquo;Now it&rsquo;s too thick,&rdquo;
he remarked. &ldquo;It needs more water.&rdquo; He poured
the fluid in with a too lavish hand, it seemed,
for he murmured: &ldquo;Gee whiz! Can&rsquo;t I get this
right? Now I&rsquo;ve got it too thin. I&rsquo;ll have to empty
part of it out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He looked around for something into which to
pour part of the batter, but every available dish in
the tent seemed to be filled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No use saving it,&rdquo; Frank went on. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just throw
some of it away. I&rsquo;ve got lots left.&rdquo; He emptied
part of the batter into a refuse pail, and his face
wore such a worried expression as he came back to
his task, that Bart and his two chums could not
hold back their laughter any longer. As they burst
into peals of mirth, Frank glanced up, and saw them
spying on him from the tent flap.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hu! you fellows think you&rsquo;re mighty smart, I
guess!&rdquo; he muttered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How are you coming on?&rdquo; asked Bart &ldquo;Are
you stocking up for fear of a blizzard, Frank?&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>Then the comical side of the situation struck the
volunteer cook, and he, too, joined in the fun.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s funny how this thing came out,&rdquo; said Frank,
with a dubious air. &ldquo;First the batter was too thick,
and then, when I put more water in, it was too thin.
Then I had too much, and I had to empty some of it
out. Then I did the same thing over again, and had
to keep on emptying. I never could seem to get it
right, and I&rsquo;ve used up nearly a sack of flour. I
put the flavoring in, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Flavoring? What flavoring?&rdquo; asked Fenn
quickly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cocoanut, I guess it was. I found it in a cocoanut
box, anyhow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never heard of cocoanut flavoring in pancakes,&rdquo;
said Fenn dubiously, &ldquo;but maybe it&rsquo;s all
right. But I&rsquo;ll show you how to mix &rsquo;em, Frank.
We&rsquo;ll just put two or three dishes of this batter
together in the pan, add a little more flour, and some
salt, and it&rsquo;ll be ready to bake,&rdquo; and, as he talked
Fenn soon beat up the batter to the right consistency,
for he had a knack of cooking. Then a frying
pan was put on the stove, for they had brought
along no regular griddle, it was greased, and Frank,
who insisted on doing the rest, was allowed to pour
out the batter, and do the turning. This part he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
managed fairly well, and soon he had a big plate
full of nicely-browned cakes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Seems to me they smell sort of funny,&rdquo; remarked
Ned, as he sat down to the table, and helped himself
liberally.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s only your imagination,&rdquo; declared
Frank. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re all right. Eat hearty, fellows,
there&rsquo;s lots of &rsquo;em.&rdquo; There was&mdash;enough for a
squad.</p>

<p>Fenn poured out a liberal amount of maple syrup
on his pile of cakes. He put a generous piece of the
top brown one in his mouth. The next minute he
uttered a yell, and made rush for the outside of
the tent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wow! Oh!&rdquo; he cried on his way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; asked Frank, as Fenn
hastily drank several glasses of water on his return.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did you say you flavored those cakes
with?&rdquo; demanded the stout youth, while Bart and
Ned paused, with their forks half raised to their
mouths.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cocoanut,&rdquo; answered Frank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Soap powder, you mean!&rdquo; exclaimed Fenn, as
he made a dash for the box that served as a cupboard,
and took out a pasteboard package that had
contained cocoanut. &ldquo;I put soap powder in this to
have handy when I washed the dishes,&rdquo; explained the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
fleshy youth, &ldquo;and you flavored the cakes with it,
Frank. Wow! Wow!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh punk!&rdquo; groaned Bart, as he pushed his plate
away from him, &ldquo;and I was counting on griddle
cakes!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Frank cautiously smelled of the pile of cakes on
his plate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Guess you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; he admitted dubiously.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry fellows, but my pancakes are a failure.&rdquo;</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII"></a>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<h3>TREED BY A WILDCAT</h3>


<p>They made the best of it, laughing and joking,
and the meal was finished on some victuals that remained
from the day before. Frank was inclined to
blame himself, and, after that, Fenn, because the
latter had put the soap powder into the cocoanut
box, but the amateur cook&rsquo;s chums were good-natured
over his failure, and comforted him with
the proverb &ldquo;accidents will happen in the best of
regulated camps.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The weather the following day turned out unexpectedly
warm, and, as Bart, Fenn and Ned elected
to remain in camp, and straighten it out somewhat,
besides cleaning their guns, and mending some torn
clothes, Frank said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Guess I&rsquo;ll go off, and try my luck, if you fellows
don&rsquo;t mind. Maybe I can bag something.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Going alone?&rdquo; asked Bart, looking up from his
rifle, which he had taken apart. &ldquo;If you wait until
after dinner I&rsquo;ll go along.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind going alone,&rdquo; was Frank&rsquo;s rejoinder,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
and this was true, for, however good a
chum he might be to the other lads, he was rather an
odd chap, and frequently went off on solitary strolls.
His friends were used to this, and did not mind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you going to take a rifle?&rdquo; asked Ned.
&ldquo;You might see some big game.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Guess not. I&rsquo;m after birds. You fellows have
scared off all the deers and bears,&rdquo; and, with a light
shotgun over his shoulder Frank set out.</p>

<p>It was lonesome enough in the woods, after leaving
the winter camp, to suit almost any one who was
fond of solitude, and Frank really rejoiced in the
calm and quietness all about him. The only sound
was the occasional flutter of a bird in the branches,
or the soft, slushing noise made by snow toppling
from the trees to the ground.</p>

<p>Frank walked on, his eyes alert for a sign of any
game that would restock the camp larder, but, for a
long time he saw nothing. He had covered about
three miles, and was beginning to think that he
would have his trip in vain, when, as he went down
into a little gully, where the snow lay rather deeper
than on the level, he heard a noise, and saw a movement
in the underbrush.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something!&rdquo; he exclaimed half aloud,
and he swung his gun around. &ldquo;Now let&rsquo;s see what
sort of a shot I am.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>He advanced cautiously, thinking he might flush
a covey of birds. But the sound was not repeated,
and, look as he did, Frank could see nothing. With
ready gun, and eyes that gazed eagerly forward, he
kept on, making as little noise as possible.</p>

<p>Suddenly he heard a yelping bark, followed by a
shrill cry of agony, and there was a great commotion
in a clump of bushes about a hundred feet directly
in front of him. Some animal or animals
were evidently threshing about in the underbrush.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A dog! It&rsquo;s a dog, and something has caught
it!&rdquo; exclaimed Frank. &ldquo;Maybe it&rsquo;s a bear! I wish
I had my rifle!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He had no thought of turning back, even though
he had but a light shotgun. The commotion increased,
the yelping and barking finally dying out,
to be succeeded by a low moan, and then there was a
silence, and Frank could hear the crunching of
bones.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor dead beast,&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;Maybe I can
get a pop at the other creature; and if I get close
enough, and put two charges of shot into it at short
range, and in the right spot, I may kill it. I&rsquo;m going
to try, anyhow.&rdquo; He little knew the danger he was
running, for he had had, as yet, no view of the
creature upon which he was creeping.</p>

<p>As he walked forward he stepped on a dead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
branch, concealed by the snow, and it broke with his
weight, a sharp snap sounding in the still forest.
Instantly the crunching of bones ceased, there was a
slight movement where the fight had taken place,
and a savage growl resounded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m in for it now,&rdquo; mused Frank. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to
see it through. I can&rsquo;t run, but I don&rsquo;t like that
growl.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He stood still for a moment, hoping the beast
would show itself. Then he advanced a few more
steps.</p>

<p>As he got to one side of the concealing bushes he
saw a curious sight. A big, lithe, tawny creature,
with ears laid back, and with flashing eyes, was
crouched down over some smaller animal, savagely
regarding the boy. It had been rending and tearing
the smaller creature, and, at a glance Frank saw that
it was a fox. It had been the whines and barking of
the fox that he had heard, and the groans had come
when death followed the stroke of the sharp claws
of the wildcat, for it was that savage and tawny
beast that now glared at Frank&mdash;a wildcat disturbed
at its meal.</p>

<p>Frank saw before him one of the tragedies of the
forest. The fox had been preying on a wild turkey,
as was evidenced by the half-consumed carcass, and
the feathers scattered all about. Then along had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
come the wildcat, intent on a meal, had crept upon
the feasting fox, had leaped down from a tree, and,
with the quickness of light, had given the death
stroke. Now Frank had come, the fourth factor in
the woodland tragedy.</p>

<p>For a moment the lad stood regarding the savage
creature, whose blazing eyes never left his face.
Then, as cautiously as he could, Frank brought his
gun to bear. Oh, how he wished he had his rifle
now, for well he knew that more than a charge of
small shot was needed to kill the big cat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But if I can give her both barrels at once, right
in the eyes, maybe it will do for her,&rdquo; he mused
quickly.</p>

<p>Once more came the menacing growl, and the cat
crouched for a spring. From her jaws dripped
foam and blood. Frank raised his gun, and took
quick aim. He pulled both triggers together, and
the recoil nearly sent him over backwards. But he
recovered his balance with an effort, and gazed
through the smoke at the crouching creature.</p>

<p>To his horror, instead of seeing her stretched out
dead, or writhing in the final struggle, the lad saw
the big, tawny body bounding over the snow toward
him. On she came, growling and snarling, and
Frank saw that he had fired too high, and that with
the small shot he had only succeeded in slightly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
wounding the wildcat on top of the head. The
creature&rsquo;s eyes had escaped, and, now with the yellow
orbs blazing with deadly hate and anger, she leaped
forward as though to serve the lad as she had served
the fox.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can I get in another shot?&rdquo; thought Frank. He
&ldquo;broke&rdquo; his breach-loader, the empty shells flew out,
and his hand sought his belt, to slip in two fresh
cartridges.</p>

<p>To his horror he found that they would not fit!
He had brought out his smaller gauge shotgun, and
the cartridges in it were the only ones available.
They had been fired. Those in his belt were too
large. And the wildcat was bounding toward him!</p>

<p>There was but one thing to do, and Frank did it.
Wheeling quickly he raced for the nearest tree which
would sustain him. Fortunately there was one not
far away. He managed to reach it well ahead of
the wildcat, and began scrambling up. He dropped
his gun, since it was useless, and only hindered him
in his ascent. And he needed to make all the haste
he could, for he was hardly well up out of reach of
the cruel claws, before the enraged brute bounded
against the foot of the tree with a snarl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll come up after me, as sure as fate!&rdquo;
thought Frank desperately. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to stop her in
some way.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>The cat began climbing, an easy task with her
long, sharp claws. Frank reached up, and saw, over
his head a dead branch, that was big and sufficiently
strong for his purpose. Working with feverish
energy he broke it off, and, when the big cat&rsquo;s head
was close enough the young hunter brought the
large end of the stick down on the skull with all his
might.</p>

<p>With a howl of rage the big beast loosed its hold,
and dropped back to the earth. Then it looked upward,
glaring at Frank as if wondering what kind
of a foe he was. But not daunted by the reception
she met, the animal once more began climbing up.
Once more Frank raised the club, and dealt her
another severe blow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope I crack your skull!&rdquo; he murmured.</p>

<p>But alas for his hopes! The blow was well delivered,
and sent the cat back snarling and growling,
but the force of it broke the branch off close to the
lad&rsquo;s hand, and the best part of his weapon fell to
the ground.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m done for, if she comes back at me!&rdquo; he
thought, but the cat had no such intentions, at
present at least. The two blows on the head had
stunned her.</p>

<p>Down at the foot of the tree crouched the brute,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
as if to announce that she would wait there until
after dark, when she would have the advantage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m in for it now,&rdquo; mused the lad. &ldquo;Treed by a
wildcat, and nothing with which to shoot her. I <i>am</i>
in a pickle. The fellows won&rsquo;t know where to look
for me, and I can&rsquo;t fire any shots to call them. I <i>am</i>
up against it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He made himself as comfortable as possible on
his small perch. At his first movement the cat
started up from her crouching position, as if to be
on the alert, but, seeing that her prey did not attempt
to descend, she again stretched out, and began
moving her paw over the place where the shot had
torn her scalp.</p>

<p>For half an hour Frank sat there, turning over
the situation in his mind. He hoped the cat might
tire of waiting, or go back to the fox she had killed,
but the animal showed no such intentions. Noon
came, and there was no change. Frank was tired
and cramped, and he began to feel the pangs of
hunger. He moved about, seeking to be comfortable,
and every time he shifted his position the wildcat
would growl, as if resenting it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe when I don&rsquo;t come home to dinner the
fellows will come looking for me,&rdquo; thought the
treed lad. &ldquo;They may be able to trace my footsteps.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>But the afternoon began to wane, and no relief
came. Frank was desperately weary, and was beginning
to be alarmed. Not only was the prospect
of a night in the tree most unpleasant, but he feared
that after dark he could not watch to ward off the
approach of the beast, whose ability to see after
nightfall was better than was his. Then, too, he
feared that his muscles might get numb, and that he
would fall.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll cut another club, and have it in readiness,&rdquo;
Frank thought, and, as there were no more
suitable dead limbs that would serve, he whittled off
with his knife, a tough green branch, that would
answer as a club.</p>

<p>This movement on his part was resented by the
cat, who raised up and tried her fore paws on the
tree trunk, tearing off bits of bark. But she did not
venture to climb. The memory of the blows on the
head probably deterred her.</p>

<p>It began to get dusk. The cat seemed to know
this, and began prowling about the foot of the tree,
as if waiting until the veil of night had completely
fallen before making another attack. Now and
then she growled and once howled dismally.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe she&rsquo;s got a mate,&rdquo; thought Frank. &ldquo;If
two of them come at me&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; He didn&rsquo;t like to
dwell on that.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>The big cat curled herself at the foot of the tree,
and looked up at the boy, not far above her head.
Then, as Frank carefully shifted his position, to get
rid of a cramp in his left leg, his fingers came in contact
with his belt filled with cartridges.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, if I had only brought the right size, or else
had my other gun,&rdquo; he mused regretfully. &ldquo;There&rsquo;d
soon be a different story to tell. As it is&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He paused, struck by a sudden thought.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By Jove! I&rsquo;ll try it!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Wonder why I
didn&rsquo;t think of it before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Taking out a cartridge, and bracing himself in the
crotch of a limb so as to have both hands free, he
dug out, with his knife, the wad that held the shot
in place. He let the leaden pellets fall to the ground.
At this the cat growled, but the lad paid no attention
to her.</p>

<p>Next he removed the wad over the powder, and
poured the black grains out into his hand. From his
pocket he took a piece of paper, and, emptying the
powder into this he laid it in his cap, which he managed
to balance on a limb in front of him. Working
rapidly in the fast-gathering darkness he emptied
several cartridges, until he had a sufficient quantity
of powder in the paper.</p>

<p>This he wadded up tightly, leaving one end<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
twisted into a sort of fuse. Next he tied a string to
his improvised bomb.</p>

<p>With trembling fingers he lighted the fuse, and
then, when it was burning well, he began to lower
the paper of powder toward the wildcat. The beast
snarled as she saw the tiny flame approaching, but
she did not withdraw. Rather she reared on her
hind feet, and was about to strike at the little tongue
of fire.</p>

<p>This was better than Frank hoped for. An instant
later there was a big puff of flame, and a dull
report. The powder in the paper had exploded almost
in the face of the wildcat.</p>

<p>With a scream of rage and pain the creature
dropped to all fours, and began clawing the dirt and
snow. The fire had burned her severely, and she
was wild with pain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; exulted Frank. &ldquo;I wish I had another!&rdquo;
He peered down at the snarling cat, and began to
open more cartridges. But it was too dark to see to
work, and he had to stop, for he spilled the powder.</p>

<p>Suddenly, above the yelps and growls of the
brute, the lad in the tree heard a hail far off in the
woods. He listened a moment, and then shouted:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here I am, fellows. Over here! I&rsquo;m treed by a
wildcat! Look out!&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re coming,&rdquo; shouted Bart&rsquo;s voice. &ldquo;Where
are you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Frank rapidly twisted some paper together,
lighted it, and waved the improvised torch above his
head. He hardly dared descend yet. A shout told
him that his light had been seen. Then, off through
the woods, he saw the flicker of a lantern.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come up easy,&rdquo; he cautioned. &ldquo;The brute is
still here, though I burned her some.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He dropped the blazing paper to the ground. It
flared up, and the cat, with a snarl, sprang away.</p>

<p>An instant later a shot rang out, and the beast
turned a somersault, falling over backward&mdash;dead.
Bart had seen the tawny body in the gleam from the
burning paper, and had fired in the nick of time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can come down now, Frank,&rdquo; he cried, as he
and the other chums rushed up to where the wildcat
was still twitching in death.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII"></a>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

<h3>THE MYSTERIOUS MAN AGAIN</h3>


<p>Frank&rsquo;s story was soon told, and he was helped
back toward camp by his comrades, for he was stiff
from his long position in the tree.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You want to be more careful of your gun, next
time,&rdquo; cautioned Bart, &ldquo;and take the right one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and you want to take some grub with you,&rdquo;
added Fenn. &ldquo;You never can tell what will happen
in the woods. Hungry, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mention it,&rdquo; begged Frank, earnestly. &ldquo;I
could even eat pancakes flavored with soap powder.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ll soon be in camp,&rdquo; remarked Ned.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got plenty to eat there. We would have
started searching for you long before this, but we
supposed you had taken some grub, and would stay
all day. But when it got dark, and you didn&rsquo;t show
up, we feared something had happened.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Something had,&rdquo; observed Frank earnestly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We had tramped about for some time before we
saw the puff of the explosion,&rdquo; went on Bart. &ldquo;You
had a great head on you, Frank, to think of that.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I had to think of something,&rdquo; was the response.
&ldquo;Wow! but that beast was a savage one!&rdquo;</p>

<p>They reached camp in due time, and Frank was
provided with a good meal, and plenty of hot coffee.</p>

<p>The warm weather continued for the next two
days, and the air was almost like spring. The boys
thoroughly enjoyed it, and went on long tramps
through the woods. They were on the lookout for
the mate of the wildcat, but saw no further traces
of the ugly beasts.</p>

<p>There was a stream, not far from camp, and
there the chums went one day, cut a hole through
the ice, which was too thick to melt much, and fished
for pickerel, with such good luck that they had a fish
dinner that day. Then on several succeeding days
they went hunting, getting some wild turkeys, and
some wild ducks, which gave them a variety of food
for their larder.</p>

<p>For a week they lived this way, and Bart was in
hopes of bagging a deer, since the snow had disappeared,
and it was lawful to shoot them. But,
though he tramped far and near he did not see any.
Once he descried one on top of a distant hill, but it
was too far off for a successful shot, and when he
started on the trail the animal dashed into a thick
forest, and was soon lost. Bart returned to camp,
somewhat dispirited.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>He practiced at a target occasionally, as did his
chums, but they could not begin to equal Bart in
making bullseyes, though Ned ran his friend a close
second.</p>

<p>The boys tramped about, did the work necessary
in camp, hunted and fished and thoroughly enjoyed
life during the mild weather of the unexpected
thaw. Not that they did not enjoy it when it was
cold and snapping, or even snowing, but they could
do much more when the weather was milder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But we&rsquo;ll pay for this,&rdquo; declared Bart one day,
when they had started on their second week of camp
life. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have a storm soon, I&rsquo;m thinking.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let it come,&rdquo; declared Fenn. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re ready for
it, and the folks know we&rsquo;re all right,&rdquo; for they had
walked to a cross-roads rural free delivery box that
day, and deposited some letters to go to Darewell,
as they knew the mail carrier would collect the
missives.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t get your deer if the snow comes,&rdquo;
spoke Frank, &ldquo;and, by the looks of the sky, we&rsquo;ll
have a flurry before night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know it, and that&rsquo;s the reason I&rsquo;m going out
this afternoon, and have another try for it. Are
you fellows coming?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not,&rdquo; announced Fenn. &ldquo;Too tired. I&rsquo;m
going to stay here and chop wood. You fellows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
won&rsquo;t do it, and we&rsquo;ve got to have some for the
fires.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll help,&rdquo; agreed Frank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you come, Ned?&rdquo; went on Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nope, I&rsquo;m going to clean my gun. There&rsquo;ll be
some good shooting after the storm, and I want to
be ready for it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, then I&rsquo;ll go alone,&rdquo; decided Bart. &ldquo;I
want a deer,&rdquo; and putting a supply of cartridges in
his belt, and seeing that his gun magazine was filled,
he started off.</p>

<p>For some time Bart tramped on without a sight of
anything. Then, when he was going through a lonely
part of the forest, if one part of that uninhabited
place was more lonely than another, he was startled
by a crashing sound in the underbrush. He started,
and threw up his gun in anticipation, but he could
not help laughing when a big rabbit, as startled as
the lad was himself, stood up and looked at him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Skip away, bunny,&rdquo; remarked Bart with a laugh,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m looking for bigger game than you,&rdquo; and he
kept on, while the hare scurried for cover.</p>

<p>Bart covered several miles, and, almost unconsciously,
he found that he was traveling in the direction
of the mud volcano, or boiling spring, having
swung around in a half-circle since leaving camp.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By Jinks!&rdquo; exclaimed the youth, as he came to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
a halt in the midst of a little clearing, &ldquo;I believe I&rsquo;ve
got an idea. That mud volcano water is partly salty.
Now, why shouldn&rsquo;t deer go there to get the salt?
They love it and I may catch one there. I never
thought of that before. I&rsquo;ve read of &lsquo;salt licks,&rsquo;
where deer congregate, but I never figured out that
our boiling spring might be one. I&rsquo;ll keep on to
there, and maybe I&rsquo;ll get a shot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This gave a new direction to his chase, and he
turned to make his way to the spring. He had not
taken ten steps before he was again startled by a
crashing in the underbrush. He thought it was another
rabbit, and he was about to pass on when he
looked up, and saw, through the leafless trees, a big
buck gazing full at him. It was only for an instant,
and before Bart could bring his rifle to bear the deer
had bounded off.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s headed for the boiling spring!&rdquo; cried Bart
in his excitement. &ldquo;Now I&rsquo;ll get him! I hope I get
a shot before it begins to snow, and it&rsquo;s likely to do it
any minute now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bart started off rapidly in the direction taken by
the buck, with his gun in readiness for a quick shot,
though he hardly hoped to get one until he had continued
the chase for some time longer. The crashing
in the bushes encouraged him, and told him that
his quarry was ahead of him, and on he rushed.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>Almost before he knew it he was within sight of
the boiling spring, and he checked his pace, hoping
to come upon the buck licking the salty deposit from
the rocks in the little stream that flowed from the
place where the mud volcano was. He thought the
animal might even stop for a drink in a fresh spring,
that was not far from the salty one.</p>

<p>As Bart peered through the bushes, with his rifle
ready to throw up to his shoulder, he was conscious
of some movement in the underbrush on the other
side of the spring.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s made a circle, and he&rsquo;s here ahead of me&mdash;on
the other side,&rdquo; thought the lad. &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ve
got him!&rdquo;</p>

<p>With eager eyes he watched. The bushes continued
to move and vibrate. Something seemed to
be coming down to the edge of the spring. Bart&rsquo;s
nerves were on edge. His hands were almost
trembling, but he controlled himself by an effort,
and he raised his gun slowly to take aim.</p>

<p>He saw something brown moving amid the
brambles. It looked like the head of a deer. Bart
slowly and cautiously raised his gun to his shoulder.
He drew a bead on the brown object.</p>

<p>A moment later, and just as the lad was about to
press the trigger, there stepped into view a man!
It was a man and not a deer that Bart had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
about to fire at, and a cold chill came over him. He
had paused just in time.</p>

<p>But as he looked at the individual whom he had
mistaken for a deer he felt a second tremor of excitement,
for, as he had a glimpse of his face Bart
was made aware that the man was none other than
the one about whom there was such a mystery&mdash;the
man who had sneaked into the schoolhouse the night
the diamond bracelet was stolen&mdash;the midnight
visitor at the camp, perhaps.</p>

<p>At the same instant that Bart was aware of this
the man saw him. He hesitated&mdash;made a gesture
as if of despair, and turned to dive into the bushes.
A moment later there came a sudden snow squall,
shutting off from Bart&rsquo;s view the man he had so
nearly shot.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIX" id="CHAPTER_XIX"></a>CHAPTER XIX</h2>

<h3>LOST IN THE WOODS</h3>


<p>Pausing for an instant to get his bearings, Bart
dashed forward, circled around the edge of the mud
volcano, and ran on in the direction he had seen the
man take.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to catch him,&rdquo; thought the lad, fiercely.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to get at the bottom of this. Why does
he seem to be following us&mdash;hanging around our
camp? What&rsquo;s he doing here? Did he take the
diamond bracelet? I&rsquo;m going to find out some of
those things&mdash;when I catch him.&rdquo; He added the
last with a grim smile, for, as he went on, and the
snow storm increased in fury, Bart was aware that
he had no easy task before him.</p>

<p>The swirling white flakes were now so thick that
he could hardly see five feet in advance, and he was
soon made unpleasantly aware of this, for he collided,
with no little force, into a tree. The shock
threw him backward, and he nearly dropped his
gun, but it had one good effect, for it made him
pause to consider what he was doing.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder if there&rsquo;s any use in me going on like
this?&rdquo; Bart reflected. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s got a good start of me,
and he evidently knows these roads as well as I do.
Guess I&rsquo;d better go back to camp, get the fellows,
and then see if I can trail him. Though if it keeps
on snowing it&rsquo;s not going to be easy to see his footprints.
I wonder if I can hear anything of him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He paused in a listening attitude, but the only
sounds that came to him were those of the wind
howling through the leafless branches of the trees,
and the swish of the snowflakes as they swirled
downward. Once Bart heard a crashing amid the
underbrush to one side. He darted in that direction,
thinking it was the fugitive.</p>

<p>There came, at that instant, a lull in the storm, and,
peering at the lad from under the shelter of a pine
tree was the big buck, the chase of which had led to
such unexpected results. Bart fired, point blank,
but he saw the deer bound away, and he knew he
had only wounded it slightly, if at all. He started
after it, but a moment later the snow began again,
more thickly than before, and everything was blotted
out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That settles it,&rdquo; murmured Bart, grimly, &ldquo;back
to camp for mine. No use keeping up the chase
to-day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was not without considerable regret that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
lad retraced his steps. He wanted, very much, to
get the buck, and he wanted still more to capture
the mysterious man who seemed to be playing such
an important part in the lives of himself and his
chums.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get the other fellows, and then we&rsquo;ll see if
we can&rsquo;t trail him,&rdquo; mused Bart, as he neared the
camp.</p>

<p>To his delight, just before he reached it, the snow
ceased falling, and he felt that now there was a
chance to trace the man by means of his footsteps,
for they would not be covered by the white crystals.
But there was the promise of more snow, and Bart
knew they had little time to spare.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come on, boys!&rdquo; cried Bart, when he came in
sight of the tents, and saw Ned and the others
sweeping away the snow from the front entrances.
&ldquo;Come on. I&rsquo;m after him!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo; demanded Frank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The mysterious man! Come&mdash;no time to lose!&rdquo;
and Bart rapidly told what he had seen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait until I get my gun, and I&rsquo;ll be with you!&rdquo;
cried Fenn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t we going to have dinner first?&rdquo; asked
Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll eat a light lunch, and take a snack with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
us,&rdquo; proposed Frank. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want to waste too
much time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In a little while they were ready to start, each one
with a few sandwiches, while Bart, in addition, carried
a small coffee pot, and a supply of the ground
material for making the beverage in the woods;
water could be had by melting snow over a fire they
would build.</p>

<p>Bart led the way toward the mud volcano, the
location of which was now well fixed in the minds of
the boys.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s where I first sighted the deer,&rdquo; Bart explained
when he reached the place. &ldquo;By Jinks! I
wish I could have potted him, though! He was a
beaut!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And where did you see our mysterious friend?&rdquo;
asked Frank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not until I got to the spring. We&rsquo;ll soon be up
to it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But when they reached the spot, which, because
of the warmth of the water, contained no trace of
snow, though elsewhere the ground was white, there
was, of course, no evidences of the man, save for
blurred footprints.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right where he stood,&rdquo; declared Bart,
&ldquo;and he went off in this direction.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then it&rsquo;s up to us to follow,&rdquo; asserted Ned. &ldquo;We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
can see his tracks. They&rsquo;re pretty plain now, but
they won&rsquo;t be in a little while, for it&rsquo;s going to snow
more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They hurried on, trailing the man like officers of
the law after a criminal. The footprints were plainly
visible in the snow, being blurred occasionally by
little drifts that had blown over them. They showed
that the man had run a good part of the way, for the
marks were far apart and irregular.</p>

<p>They had gone on for perhaps a mile, seeing no
sign of their quarry, but loath to give up, when
there was a sudden darkening of the atmosphere, the
wind increased in violence, and then the air was
again filled with flying flakes, so thick that the lads
could not see ten feet ahead.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Might as well give up now,&rdquo; called Bart. &ldquo;His
tracks will be covered in five minutes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s wait a bit, and see if it stops snowing,&rdquo;
proposed Frank, and they did, standing in the
shelter of some trees. But the white flakes showed
no inclination to stop, and with something like
despair in their hearts the four chums prepared to
return to camp.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And it&rsquo;s about time, too,&rdquo; remarked Ned, looking
at his watch. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s after five, and it will soon be
dark. Let&rsquo;s eat. I&rsquo;m hungry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, wait a while,&rdquo; advised Bart. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
be back at camp. I think I know a short cut, and
then we can have a hot supper.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, go ahead,&rdquo; agreed Frank. &ldquo;A short cut
will be just the thing. I&rsquo;m tired.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bart started off with an air of confidence, hesitated
a moment, and then plunged his hand in his
pocket.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll be hanged!&rdquo; he burst out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; inquired Fenn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My compass&mdash;I haven&rsquo;t got it. Let me take one
of you fellow&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t any,&rdquo; said Fenn. &ldquo;Left it in camp.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So did I,&rdquo; added Frank and Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You did?&rdquo; asked Bart, blankly.</p>

<p>There was a pause&mdash;the boys knew what it meant
to be out in the woods in a snowstorm, without the
little swinging needle to guide them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did you do with the one you had, Bart?&rdquo;
asked Frank. &ldquo;You had one, didn&rsquo;t you, when you
were out after the deer, and saw the man?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure I did, but I took it out of my pocket when I
stuffed this lunch in, and must have forgotten to put
it back. I remember now, I left it on the box in the
tent. But I thought you fellows would sure have
one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, we haven&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Frank, with an uneasy
laugh. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s to be done?&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I dare say we can get back&mdash;somehow,&rdquo;
went on Bart. &ldquo;Come on, fellows. I think I know
the way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They started off, with no light hearts, and
tramped through the blinding snow, but it was with
little confidence. Several times Bart stopped to get
his bearings. Once he and Fenn disputed about a
certain turn, and Bart so insisted that he was right,
that the other two lads agreed with him. It grew
darker, and they wandered into drifts, stumbled
into unexpected hollows, and brought up against
trees, sometimes falling over stumps. At last Bart
said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fellows, there&rsquo;s no use going on this way any
farther. I&rsquo;m off the track. I shouldn&rsquo;t have started
out. The fact of the matter is that we&rsquo;re lost in the
woods, and we&rsquo;ve got to make the best of it!&rdquo;</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XX" id="CHAPTER_XX"></a>CHAPTER XX</h2>

<h3>A NIGHT OF MISERY</h3>


<p>Bart&rsquo;s announcement brought looks of blank
astonishment and dismay to the faces of his chums.
They had so depended on him, that, to have him go
back on them in this fashion, was a shock.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you sure we&rsquo;re lost?&rdquo; asked Ned, slowly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No doubt of it, in my mind,&rdquo; answered Bart, and
he laughed a little. The strain of keeping up the
pace on a route he was not at all sure of, was
harder than admitting the fact of being lost in the
wilderness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are we going to do?&rdquo; asked Fenn, rather
helplessly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The first thing to do will be to gather wood for a
fire before it&rsquo;s too dark to see,&rdquo; announced Bart,
with assumed if not real cheerfulness. &ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ll
make a blaze, and eat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The mention of food was cheering in itself, to say
nothing of the prospect of a fire, and then, too, the
act of being busy took from the minds of the lads
the thoughts that they were lost.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>In a short time they had gathered quite a pile of
wood. Some of it was dry, for it was under the
low-lying branches of spruce and hemlock trees, and
the snow had been kept from it. From the interior
of hollow logs some &ldquo;punk&rdquo; was obtained, and this,
together with some dead branches, that had lodged
in a hollow under a big rock, made enough fuel to
get a blaze started.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But where are we going to stay to-night?&rdquo; asked
Frank, when the flickering flames had dispelled some
of the darkness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about that,&rdquo; advised Bart. &ldquo;Some
of these fir trees are as good as a tent, and nearly as
dry. We can stay under them until morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will we be any better off by morning?&rdquo; asked
Ned, dubiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lots better,&rdquo; replied Bart, cheerfully. &ldquo;But let&rsquo;s
get ready for some hot coffee. Lucky we brought
the pot along. Ned, you gather some snow in it,
and we&rsquo;ll put it on to melt. Fenn, you get some flat
stones, to make a sort of fireplace. Frank, you cut
some branches from that hemlock, and make cots
under that big tree over there. I&rsquo;ll help. That will
be our tent to-night. Everybody get busy, now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ordering his chums about in this way was the best
thing Bart could have done, and, in a short time,
everyone was so occupied that he had no time to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
think of the unpleasant situation. Soon the coffee
was boiling away, and Bart had arranged an old
log, under the shelter of a tree, for a table. Thereon
their frugal meal was spread out.</p>

<p>Luckily each lad carried a drinking cup with him,
and this served in which to dispense the coffee.
They had no milk, of course, but Bart had been
thoughtful enough to bring along some sugar, so
the beverage was not at all unpalatable. Then, by
the light of the campfire, they sat about, munched
their sandwiches, drank the strong coffee, and talked
of their afternoon&rsquo;s adventure.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, that isn&rsquo;t a half bad place to sleep,&rdquo; remarked
Fenn, as he looked at the &ldquo;bunk&rdquo; Bart and
Frank had made.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure, it&rsquo;s great,&rdquo; added Ned, but it was probably
the cheerfulness engendered by a hot drink and food
that made them see things with more hopeful eyes.</p>

<p>They had no blankets, but they wore thick clothing,
and had on heavy coats, so their situation was
not so bad. Besides, the weather was not cold,
though it was growing more so, and the snow still
fell thickly. The heavy branches of the tree under
which the boys crawled, served to protect them.</p>

<p>They stretched out, and hoped to be able to sleep,
in order that morning might come the more quickly,
but either the strong coffee, or the unusual situation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
kept them wide awake. They lay close together, for
the sake of warmth, but first Bart would turn over,
restlessly, and then, in sequence, Fenn, Ned and
Frank would do the same thing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter; can&rsquo;t you fellows sleep?&rdquo;
asked Ned, at length.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; can you?&rdquo; inquired Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nope. Let&rsquo;s talk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right. Say, what do you suppose that man
was doing around the mud volcano?&rdquo; ventured
Frank.</p>

<p>They had discussed this, in all its bearings, several
times that afternoon, but it was a subject full of new
possibilities, and they eagerly welcomed another
chance to talk about it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think he was after mud turtles,&rdquo; said Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say,&rdquo; asked Fenn, suddenly, &ldquo;did it ever strike
you fellows that this fellow might be a detective?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A detective?&rdquo; gasped the other three.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; after us,&rdquo; went on Stumpy. &ldquo;You know
we&rsquo;re suspected of taking that bracelet. It hasn&rsquo;t
been found, and what would be more natural than
for Professor Long to hire a private detective, and
have him shadow us. I didn&rsquo;t think of that until
just now, but I&rsquo;ll wager I&rsquo;m right. You&rsquo;ll find that
man is a detective, and he&rsquo;s watching us; trying to
get a trace of the bracelet. Maybe he thinks we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
have it, and are going to hide it off in the woods
here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say!&rdquo; cried Bart, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s not a bad &lsquo;think&rsquo; of
yours, Stumpy. I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised but what
you are right,&rdquo; and then they fell to discussing that
aspect of the case. It was quite a reversal of the
former situation. Instead of them being after the
mysterious man, he might be after the chums.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But how do you account for him entering the
school that night, before the bracelet was stolen?&rdquo;
asked Frank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe he was shadowing us&mdash;or, rather, you
fellows&mdash;&rdquo; said Fenn, who, as will be remembered,
was not present on that occasion. &ldquo;Or, maybe we&rsquo;re
mistaken, and the man Bart saw to-day may not
have been the one who entered the school.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;s the same one,&rdquo; declared Bart, with conviction.</p>

<p>There was more discussion, and, if it did nothing
more, it served a good turn, for it shunted the
thoughts of the lads into new channels, and they began
to feel sleepy.</p>

<p>But, just as they were about to doze off, there
came an exclamation of dismay from Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; asked Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stream of water trickling down my neck,&rdquo; was
the answer. &ldquo;I believe it&rsquo;s raining!&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>There was no doubt of it. Instead of turning
colder it had grown warmer, and the snow had
changed to rain. The tree, thick as were the
branches, was little protection against the rain, and,
as it increased to a regular downpour, the plight of
our heroes was miserable in the extreme. There
was nothing to be done but make the best of it.
They huddled together, turned up the collars of their
coats, and tried to crawl to spots more or less protected.
But they were soon pretty wet, and, to add
to their misery, they saw their fire die down, and go
out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wow! This is fierce!&rdquo; exclaimed Ned, as a
stream of water trickled down his neck. &ldquo;I wish it
was morning. It wouldn&rsquo;t be so bad if we could
travel.&rdquo; But there was no help for it, and they
had to sit there in the storm and darkness, waiting
for daylight.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI"></a>CHAPTER XXI</h2>

<h3>UNEXPECTED HELP</h3>


<p>Never had hours seemed to drag so slowly.
There was nothing to be heard save the drip, drip of
the rain in the forest, and the mournful sound of the
wind in the trees. Once Bart went out, and tried to
coax into a blaze the few, faint, remaining embers
of the fire, but it was out of the question. He did
have it started, but a swaying of the trees overhead
sent down a shower of drops, and the blaze was
completely extinguished.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hang the luck!&rdquo; exclaimed Bart, as he hurried
back into the partial shelter of the tree under which
were his chums. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all my fault, for not keeping
my compass.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, we should have kept ours,&rdquo; declared Fenn.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s up to us, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, then, I shouldn&rsquo;t have seen that mysterious
man,&rdquo; went on Bart, determined to blame himself
in some fashion, &ldquo;and we wouldn&rsquo;t have come on
this wild-goose chase.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s a good thing you did see him,&rdquo; said
Frank. &ldquo;We want to know what he&rsquo;s up to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I only hope he&rsquo;s as badly off as we are,&rdquo; put in
Ned, with a shiver. &ldquo;But say, fellows,&rdquo; he went on,
in a few minutes, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you think it&rsquo;s slacking up
some?&rdquo;</p>

<p>They all listened. There was no doubt about it,
the rain was less in violence, but the wind was
rising.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe it&rsquo;s going to clear,&rdquo; suggested Fenn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If it does, it&rsquo;ll be colder,&rdquo; was Bart&rsquo;s opinion. It
did clear, shortly after that, and there was a decided
drop in temperature. Through the boughs of their
shelter the boys could see the stars coming out.
Miserable, and feeling chilled to the bone, the chums
crowded close together.</p>

<p>It soon grew so cold that they had to come out of
their shelter to move about and get their blood in
circulation. But this served a good purpose, for it
gave them something to do. At last a faint streak
of light appeared in the east&mdash;the herald of the rising
sun&mdash;and, a little later, the red rim of Old Sol
appeared. Never was the big luminary more welcome.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now for a fire!&rdquo; cried Ned, &ldquo;that is, if we can
find any dry wood.&rdquo; They did manage to pick up a
few sticks from inside a hollow log where they had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
placed them the night before, in anticipation of some
emergency, and soon they were warming themselves
in front of the flames. But there was nothing to
eat, and no coffee left, though Bart did manage to
make a potful of what passed for it out of the
grounds of what they had used the night before.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, let&rsquo;s start for camp,&rdquo; proposed Frank,
when they had drunk the hot, if not palatable beverage.
&ldquo;Think you can find the way, Bart?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess so&mdash;I&rsquo;ll try, anyhow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They started off, getting the direction as best they
could by the sun, and for an hour tramped forward,
feeling, on the whole, rather miserable, but hoping
to soon be in camp.</p>

<p>Several hours passed, and they seemed to be no
nearer the place where their tents were. Bart&rsquo;s face
wore a puzzled look. He stared around at the trees,
as if they would help him solve the problem. Then
he said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fellows, I&rsquo;m sorry, but I don&rsquo;t know where we
are.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lost again, do you mean?&rdquo; asked Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe we&rsquo;ve been un-lost, if that&rsquo;s the
proper term,&rdquo; went on Bart. &ldquo;I guess we haven&rsquo;t
been on the right path since last night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are we going to do?&rdquo; asked Frank, helplessly.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m as hungry as a bear.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;m almost frozen,&rdquo; added Bart, with a
shiver, &ldquo;so you&rsquo;re no worse off than the rest of us,&rdquo;
and there was a note of impatience in his voice.</p>

<p>The chums looked at each other. Their plight
was disagreeable, not to say desperate. They knew
that the forest in which they had encamped was
large in extent, and was seldom visited. If they had
to spend another night and day in it the consequences
might be serious.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; began Bart, &ldquo;I suppose the only thing to
do is to keep on. We may strike the right path.
There are several trails around here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was about to start off again, when they were
all startled by hearing a crackling in the underbrush.
It seemed to come from their left.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Get your gun ready, Bart,&rdquo; whispered Fenn.
&ldquo;Maybe it&rsquo;s a deer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe it&rsquo;s that mysterious man,&rdquo; came from
Ned.</p>

<p>Bart had raised his rifle, and, a moment later
some one emerged from the thick trees, and stood
on the edge of a little clearing, confronting the boys.
The newcomer was a youth of about their own age,
and on his back was evidently a camping pack. He
carried a gun, and at the sight of Bart, with half-raised
rifle, the other slowly brought his weapon
around for quick use.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p>But Fenn, who had been staring at the latest arrival
with eager eyes, suddenly cried out:</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s William Perry! Don&rsquo;t you know him, fellows?
The lad whose mother took us in at the time
of the blizzard&mdash;William Perry&mdash;whom we found
in a snowbank in New York!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;William Perry?&rdquo; faltered Bart, lowering his
rifle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;William Perry?&rdquo; came from Ned and Frank, in
a sort of a chorus.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Darewell Chums!&rdquo; exclaimed the other lad,
while wonder spread over his face. &ldquo;The Darewell
Chums here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fenn started toward William on the run. He
was soon shaking hands with him, and leading him
over to where Ned, Frank and Bart stood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;However in the world did you get here?&rdquo; asked
Bart. &ldquo;Are you lost, too?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied William Perry, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m working for a
lumber company, and I&rsquo;m on my way from one
camp to another. I had to spend last night in the
woods. But what are you doing here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been out in the woods all night, too,&rdquo;
said Frank. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re camping, but we lost our way,&rdquo;
and he quickly explained the circumstances.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s your camp?&rdquo; asked William, who, as
my readers will remember, was the son of the widow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
in whose house the chums found shelter during a
blizzard that overtook them when they were on a
hunting trip, as told in the second volume of this
series entitled &ldquo;The Darewell Chums in the City.&rdquo;
Later they found William in New York. He had
gone to become a sailor, but had deserted because of
a brutal captain, and went into hiding. He was
found half frozen in a snowbank, from which the
chums rescued him, and sent him back home.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our camp?&rdquo; repeated Bart, in answer to William&rsquo;s
questions, &ldquo;I only wish we knew where it
was.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I mean what&rsquo;s it near?&rdquo; went on William.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, the mud volcano,&rdquo; replied Frank, &ldquo;if you
know where that is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>William did, and quickly said so.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been working for this lumber concern for
about six months,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;and I know these
woods pretty well. But I always go prepared to
spend a night in them, as I had to last night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And can you show us the way to our camp?&rdquo;
asked Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure. You&rsquo;re not more than five miles from it.
I guess you&rsquo;ve been going around in a circle. Come
on, I&rsquo;ll show you,&rdquo; and with the confidence of experience
William Perry led the way through the
woods. He had appeared in the nick of time.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII"></a>CHAPTER XXII</h2>

<h3>CHRISTMAS IN CAMP</h3>


<p>With new hope in their hearts the chums followed
William. They did not mind the cold or hunger
now, but hurried on, intent on reaching their
tents, donning dry clothing, and starting a roaring
fire. Then they would have something to eat.</p>

<p>On the way William told them of his new position.
Following his experience in New York, after
he had run away from the cruel sea captain, he had
worked at odd jobs. Then, on his return to his
home, near Darewell, the chums&rsquo; fathers had gotten
a good position for him.</p>

<p>Some time previous to his opportune meeting with
the lost lads, William explained, he had taken service
with the lumber company, which owned most of
the woods where the winter camp was. It was part
of the youth&rsquo;s duties to go from camp to camp with
documents and messages.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine, too,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;when the weather is
good. When it&rsquo;s too bad, I stay in camp with the
men, but I must have made a miscalculation this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
time, for I was caught in the storm. But it happened
for the best, after all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what,&rdquo; agreed Bart. &ldquo;If it hadn&rsquo;t been
for you I don&rsquo;t know what we&rsquo;d have done. Can
you stay in camp with us for a while?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, long enough to have dinner, if you&rsquo;ve got
enough to eat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;ve got plenty,&rdquo; Ned assured him.
&ldquo;Bart&rsquo;s a good shot, you know,&rdquo; and the chums took
turns in explaining how they had come to make a
winter camp in the woods. They said nothing about
the missing diamond bracelet, however, nor about
the mysterious man.</p>

<p>Camp was reached none too soon for the comfort
of our heroes. They found nothing disturbed,
and from their stock of dry wood, under one tent,
a roaring fire was made. The lads changed to dry
clothes, had a hot meal, which William Perry shared
with them, and then he said he must be on his way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you spend a week with us?&rdquo; invited Frank,
as the lumber lad was about to go.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid not. This is my busy season, you
know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have it!&rdquo; cried Fenn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s hear it, Stumpy,&rdquo; suggested Bart. &ldquo;Out
with it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; went on the fleshy lad, &ldquo;next Tuesday is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
Christmas. You don&rsquo;t have to work Christmas, do
you, William?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I guess not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll tell you what to do. Spend Christmas
here with us. We&rsquo;re going to have a good time.
Not much in the way of presents, for we didn&rsquo;t
bring any out in the woods, but we&rsquo;ll have a Christmas
tree, even if Bart does want to hang up his
stockings,&rdquo; and Fenn winked at his chums.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It sounds good,&rdquo; spoke William, wistfully. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t believe I can get home for Christmas, or I
would go see my folks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And we&rsquo;ll have roast wild turkey, rabbit stew,
partridge potpie and bear steak, also some venison, if
Bart has any luck,&rdquo; went on Fenn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It sounds better and better.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And then there&rsquo;s going to be a plum pudding,&rdquo;
added Fenn proudly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A plum pudding!&rdquo; they all cried.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I brought all the materials along. We&rsquo;re
going to have a regular plum pudding for Christmas!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;m coming,&rdquo; promised William. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get
along now, and hurry on to the lumber camp. I&rsquo;ll
ask the boss for a few days off, so I can get here
Saturday, and stay over until the next Wednesday,
which will be the day after Christmas.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>They voted that plan a good one, and soon afterward
William was tramping back through the
woods, having promised to be on hand at the time
specified.</p>

<p>The chums felt no ill effects from their night in
the woods, for they followed Bart&rsquo;s advice and took
plenty of hot ginger tea, made from the materials
Alice had supplied.</p>

<p>The next few days were busy ones for the campers.
They made some improvements about the
tents, arranged an extra bed for William, and
brought in a good supply of wood, which was put
under shelter. Bart went hunting several times, and
did manage to get a buck, but it was smaller than
the one he had chased. Several rabbits, a number
of partridges, and some wild turkeys were shot,
which, together with the supplies already on hand,
promised an abundance for Christmas.</p>

<p>Fenn, meanwhile, true to his promise, was busy
over the plum pudding, which, he said, would take
several days to make.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should think it would,&rdquo; remarked Ned, one
afternoon, when Fenn was occupied with chopping
bowl and knife in the cook tent. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a wonder you
didn&rsquo;t start last Fourth of July, Stumpy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right, I know how to make this pudding,&rdquo;
asserted Fenn, with a superior air.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s mighty proud of it,&rdquo; whispered Frank to
Ned, as they moved away. &ldquo;I wish we could play
some joke on him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe we can.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll think of one,&rdquo; went on Frank, who had not
yet gotten over his failure with the pancakes, for
which he partly blamed Fenn.</p>

<p>William arrived that Saturday afternoon, and was
soon made to feel at home in the camp. He was
given a spare gun, and on the Monday before Christmas,
all five went for a hunt, though they did not
expect to go far from camp.</p>

<p>They bagged some small game, and Bart made a
remarkable kill of a brace of partridges, getting one
each with his left and right barrels, when it seemed
that both birds would escape.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s fine shooting, Bart,&rdquo; remarked William.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Bart&rsquo;s a good shot,&rdquo; answered Ned proudly,
and not at all jealous. But before long Bart was
destined to make a more remarkable shot than that.</p>

<p>As the boys had said there was to be practically
nothing in the way of giving each other presents
while in camp. Fenn, for the joke of the thing,
rigged up a small Christmas tree, on which were
hung pretended gifts.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, let&rsquo;s get to bed early to-night,&rdquo; suggested
Frank on Christmas eve.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;And get up a good appetite for my plum pudding,&rdquo;
suggested Fenn. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a dandy! I&rsquo;ve got it
all made, and all I have to do is to warm it, and make
the sauce. It&rsquo;s in that box,&rdquo; and he pointed proudly
to one in the cook tent.</p>

<p>Christmas was ushered in with a snow storm,
which made the woods a place of beauty. It was not
very cold, and the boys, jumping from their beds,
wished each other the joys of the season.</p>

<p>Most of the work of getting ready the dinner had
been done the day previous, so there was little work
Christmas morning. They went hunting, but did
not see anything to shoot, and, in fact they did not
need anything, as the larder was well stocked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; ordered Fenn, on their return, &ldquo;get a
move on, fellows. Get the table set, and I&rsquo;ll look
after the other things,&rdquo; for the turkey and some
partridges had been partly cooked the day previous,
and needed only a final turn in the oven. Several
dainties had been brought from home, in anticipation
of this feast, and they were now set out.</p>

<p>Such a dinner as it was! Eaten in the midst of
a silent wilderness, with the keen sharp air of winter
all about, the boys had appetites that would have
been the envy and despair of a person troubled with
dyspepsia.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, have you had enough, fellows?&rdquo; asked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
Fenn, as he stood over the platters of turkey and
partridge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Too much,&rdquo; groaned Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope you have room for the pudding,&rdquo; spoke
Fenn, anxiously. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say you can&rsquo;t eat some of
my plum pudding! Why I have a regular sauce,
made from a recipe in a book, to eat on it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I guess we can tackle a slice,&rdquo; remarked
William, and Fenn went proudly to the stove, where
the pudding was being kept hot, and soon had it on
the table, flanked by two bowls of savory sauce.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me carve it,&rdquo; begged Ned, with a look at
Frank and Bart. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll serve it, Fenn. You&rsquo;ve done
enough.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; agreed the manufacturer of the pudding.</p>

<p>Ned carefully inserted a knife in the smoking
heap on the plate. Fenn looked proudly on, as a generous
piece was passed to William, as the guest of
the day. Then Bart and Frank were served. The
latter gave a sudden outcry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I say, Fenn!&rdquo; he demanded. &ldquo;Is this a joke, or
what? I thought you were going to give us plum
pudding!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So I am. What&rsquo;s that on your plate?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what it is,&rdquo; declared Frank, indignantly,
&ldquo;only I know it isn&rsquo;t plum pudding. It looks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
like dough, but it&rsquo;s got the queerest collection of
plums in it that I ever saw. Look, here&rsquo;s a piece
of rubber boot, part of a shoe, some pine cones, some
sticks of wood, stones, part of a rope, some brass
cartridges and some flannel bandages. Plum pudding!
Take a look,&rdquo; and Frank passed to the astonished
Fenn, the plate of the dubious looking
mess.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXIII"></a>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>

<h3>FOOTPRINTS IN THE SNOW</h3>


<p>For several seconds Fenn said nothing. He sat
and gazed in blank dismay at the odd conglomeration
on the plate that Frank had passed to him. At
last he asked faintly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it&mdash;is it all this&mdash;this way?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mine is,&rdquo; declared Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And mine,&rdquo; added Ned, while William simply
passed up his plate for inspection.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a trick! A mean trick!&rdquo; burst out Fenn indignantly.
&ldquo;And I know who did it! Frank Roscoe,
you did this to get even with us for my mistake about
putting soap powder in the cocoanut box, so that it
got into the pancakes! But that wasn&rsquo;t my fault.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You had no right to take the cocoanut out of a
box, and put soap powder in without telling a fellow,&rdquo;
replied Frank. &ldquo;If it hadn&rsquo;t been for that my
cakes would have been a success, and I suppose if
you&rsquo;d been more careful your plum pudding wouldn&rsquo;t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
have so much trash in. As it is I don&rsquo;t see how we
can eat it,&rdquo; and he poked gingerly at the mess on his
plate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you fellows may call this a joke, but I
don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; burst out Fenn, now angry in earnest, and he
started to leave the table.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hold on, old chap. Wait a minute,&rdquo; advised
Bart, soothingly. &ldquo;I guess it&rsquo;s gone far enough.
William, just hand out the other pudding, will you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The visitor, with a grin, took a covered dish from
behind the stove, where it had been set to keep warm.
He lifted off the cover, and displayed to the astonished
Fenn the original plum pudding, smelling
most delicious, and smoking hot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Try some of this,&rdquo; said Ned. &ldquo;Maybe it will be
better.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I&mdash;what&mdash;where&mdash;what makes&mdash;is it&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
stammered Fenn, and then his chums burst into a
laugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s the original pudding,&rdquo; explained Frank.
&ldquo;We just wanted to have a little fun with you, that&rsquo;s
all. We hid away the pudding you made, and, at
the last minute, substituted one of our own that contained
all the odds and ends we could pick up in
camp, held together with a lot of dough. I guess we
can throw it away now, and eat the real thing,&rdquo; and
he emptied his plate, and those of his companions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
of the dubious mess, and dished out some of the
real plum pudding.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! Um! This is something like!&rdquo; murmured
Ned, with his mouth full. &ldquo;Great stuff, Stumpy!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you like it?&rdquo; asked the now delighted Fenn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure!&rdquo; came in an enthusiastic chorus, and the
Christmas dinner was well rounded off by the pudding
that Fenn had made with such care.</p>

<p>William spent the remainder of the day in camp
with his friends. They went for a walk in the afternoon,
did some shooting at targets, for Bart decreed
that the game must have a holiday as well as the
hunters, and at night, inside the snug tent, with the
fire blazing brightly in the stove, and the cold wind
blowing outside, they spent a jolly evening, singing
songs and telling stories.</p>

<p>William bade his friends good-bye the next morning,
and started off through the woods, with his pack
upon his back. The chums felt a little lonesome after
his departure, but it soon wore off, for there was
much to do, to get in wood and water, straighten up
the camp, and prepare for a storm, which, according
to all the evidences, was soon to break.</p>

<p>It did that night. All the next day, the following
night, and part of the next day the wind blew with
unabated violence, and the snow was heaped in big
drifts.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>Fortunately the camp was in a sheltered position,
and the drifts were not high immediately around it,
but when the boys ventured out they found it hard
traveling, for the snow was deep. All around, the
woods were covered with a mantle of white, which
had sifted down through the trees, while the firs,
spruces, hemlocks and pines, which had heavy foliage
that caught the white crystals, were mounds of
white.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good thing we had plenty to eat,&rdquo; observed
Bart, as he and his chums looked around the camp,
&ldquo;for we never could have gotten it during the
storm.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; agreed Fenn, &ldquo;but, as it is, we&rsquo;ll
have to get something soon, unless we want to live on
canned stuff. The fresh meat is nearly gone.&rdquo; For,
while practically prisoners in their tents during the
storm, they had eaten considerable, and the cupboard
was somewhat depleted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;ll soon stock up again,&rdquo; declared Bart.
&ldquo;It will be good hunting now, and, though we can&rsquo;t
shoot any deer, I may get a chance at another bear,
and there will be plenty of rabbits and game birds.
We&rsquo;ll take a chance at it after breakfast.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They started out, taking care to have their compasses
with them, though they did not expect to go
far. No bears were to be seen, but partridge, pheasants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
and wild turkeys were plentiful, and, in addition
to getting a supply of these, they shot several rabbits.</p>

<p>In the tent that evening, before going to bed, the
boys were cleaning their guns, in anticipation of a
hunt the following day. Suddenly Fenn, who was
nearest the flap, uttered a word of caution.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; he said in a whisper. &ldquo;I think I hear
something.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The others became silent at once, but they heard
nothing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Guess it was the wind, Stumpy,&rdquo; observed Bart,
as he put an oiled rag down the barrel of his rifle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; assented the stout lad, as he arose and
peered out. He came back, remarking: &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t
see anything, but I thought I heard some one prowling
around.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was not until the next morning that the boys
recalled the incident of the night previous. Then
Frank, who was walking about the cleared space in
front of the tents, to get up an appetite, as he expressed
it, uttered a cry of wonder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look here!&rdquo; he shouted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; cried Fenn, running up to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A turtle!&rdquo; went on Frank, picking up one of the
reptiles that was slowly crawling along, made sluggish
by the cold. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a mud turtle, and see,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
some one has been walking around here,&rdquo; and he
pointed to footprints in the snow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was sure I heard some one last night,&rdquo; declared
Fenn, triumphantly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That mysterious man again, I&rsquo;ll wager a cookie!&rdquo;
exclaimed Bart. &ldquo;But what is the turtle doing here?
Is it the same one you had, Stumpy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s a different kind. Maybe that mysterious
man dropped it, and was hunting around for it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hard to tell,&rdquo; remarked Frank. &ldquo;Anyhow, isn&rsquo;t
it rather queer, Stumpy, to see mud turtles out this
time of year?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure it is. They don&rsquo;t come out by themselves
to play around in the snow. Either some one dug
this one up, or some one had it and dropped it. Well,
I guess the best thing we can say is that it&rsquo;s part of
the mystery. If we could only meet with that man
who seems so afraid of meeting us, matters might
be explained. As it is&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Fenn could only finish
by a shrug of his shoulders.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXIV"></a>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>

<h3>A SHOT IN TIME</h3>


<p>For some time the young hunters discussed the
curious happening, but they could arrive at no solution
of the mystery. Fenn took the turtle, and put
it in a box back of the stove, hardly knowing why
he did so, except that he had some notion of adding
it to his collection, or of giving it to Professor Long.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s no use talking about it any more,&rdquo;
decided Bart. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get ready and go off on another
hunting trip. We haven&rsquo;t got much longer to
stay here&mdash;not more than two weeks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This suited his companions, and soon they were
cleaning their guns, sorting cartridges and fitting
them in their belts, taking care not to make the mistake
Frank did, when he was treed by the wildcat;
and looking to their clothing and hunting boots.</p>

<p>That afternoon Fenn was seen to be busy in the
cook tent. He looked out now and then, disclosing
a face on which were many spots of flour.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What you up to now, Stumpy?&rdquo; asked Bart,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
who had finished his hunting preparations. &ldquo;Making
something good for grub?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; answered Fenn. &ldquo;How does meat pie
strike you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, as long as it isn&rsquo;t made of rubber boots
and flannel bandages,&rdquo; answered Frank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not this time,&rdquo; declared Stumpy. &ldquo;There&rsquo;ll be
no monkey-shines with this pie. We&rsquo;ll have it hot
for breakfast before we start off hunting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was busy all the rest of that afternoon, and,
judging by the time he spent over it, the pie was going
to be an elaborate affair.</p>

<p>Fenn was the first one up the next morning. He
tumbled out of his blankets, made a hurried toilette,
and, a few minutes later was heard to excitedly cry
out:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here! That&rsquo;ll do you fellows! A joke&rsquo;s a joke,
but this is too much! Where did you put it, you
lobsters?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where did we put what?&rdquo; asked Bart, sticking
his head out of the tent flap. &ldquo;Why this unseemly
noise, Stumpy, my son?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know well enough. Where&rsquo;s the meat pie?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean to tell us you&rsquo;ve gone and walked
in your sleep, and eaten that meat pie we were to
have for breakfast; have you?&rdquo; cried Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I haven&rsquo;t; but some of you fellows have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
hidden it,&rdquo; declared Fenn. &ldquo;Come on, now. This is
enough of that joke. Tell me where it is, Bart, and
I&rsquo;ll warm it up for breakfast.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, I haven&rsquo;t seen it, Stumpy.&rdquo; Bart&rsquo;s voice
had the ring of innocence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you hid it, Frank.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not on your life. I&rsquo;ve got too good an appetite.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then Ned must have put it somewhere. Tell us,
Ned.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Search me!&rdquo; cried Ned, earnestly. &ldquo;I never
touched it, Stumpy. Where did you put it when you
went to bed?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the cook tent, high up on a box. Some of
you fellows must have taken it, for snow fell in the
night, and there wasn&rsquo;t a track going into the tent
when I came out here. You fellows took it before
you came in to bed. Own up, now!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; declared Bart, and the others asserted
their innocence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, somebody has it!&rdquo; insisted Stumpy, earnestly.
&ldquo;The meat pie is gone, and it was a dandy,
too!&rdquo;</p>

<p>His distress was evident. The other lads, likewise,
felt the loss of their chief breakfast dish.
Stumpy looked at them with an eye of suspicion, but
they gazed frankly back at him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That mysterious man&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; began Frank.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait a minute,&rdquo; suggested Bart, who had finished
dressing. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take a look.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He went carefully out to the cook tent, and made
several observations. Then he stooped down and
carefully brushed off the light layer of snow that had
fallen during the night. When the undercrust was
exposed he uttered an exclamation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the tracks of the thief who stole the meat
pie, Stumpy,&rdquo; he said, pointing to some marks in the
snow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who was it?&rdquo; asked Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A fox,&rdquo; answered Bart. &ldquo;He sneaked into the
tent after we had gone to bed, and took the pie off
the top of the box where Fenn had set it. Then he
carried it off, and the snow obligingly came and covered
up his tracks. I guess if we look far enough
we can find the basin that held the pie, where the fox
dropped it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They made a circle about the camp, and soon Fenn
uttered a cry of triumph.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the pan!&rdquo; he called. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s empty. No
meat pie for breakfast this morning,&rdquo; he added regretfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish we could shoot that fox!&rdquo; exclaimed Ned
vindictively. &ldquo;As it is you&rsquo;ll have to give us pancakes,
Fenn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was no help for it. The pie dish had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
licked clean, though how the fox had managed to
carry it from the tent was something of a mystery.
However, Fenn soon stirred up a mess of cakes from
self-raising flour, and a hot breakfast was partaken
of, while hunting plans for that day were discussed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to look for the thieving fox,&rdquo; declared
Fenn. &ldquo;The idea of that dandy pie going to waste!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No foxes,&rdquo; insisted Bart. &ldquo;Nothing less than
bear to-day, fellows. We don&rsquo;t want to bother with
small game,&rdquo; and they started out.</p>

<p>But the bears seemed to have warning of the approach
of the young Nimrods, for none was in evidence,
though there were tracks in the snow, which
Bart, enthusiastic sportsman that he was, followed
hopefully for some distance, until they disappeared
down in a deep gulch, where even he did not think it
wise to follow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s separate a bit,&rdquo; suggested Frank, after another
mile or two had been covered. &ldquo;I think there
are too many of us here. Ned and I will go off together,
and you and Stumpy do the same, Bart.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; agreed the stout lad, and Bart nodded
assent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come on over this way, Stumpy,&rdquo; called Bart
to his partner. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get all the bears, and leave the
rabbits for those fellows.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was about an hour after this that Bart, who had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
gone on a little in advance of Fenn, whose wind was
not of the best, heard a grunt of surprise from his
stout comrade. Mingled with it was an expression
of fear. The lads had just passed through a little
clearing, and Fenn had stopped to look back. In an
instant Bart saw what Fenn was gazing at.</p>

<p>It was a noble buck, with wide, branching antlers,
and he stood on the edge of the little glade, glaring,
as if in defiance, at those who had invaded his home.
As Bart looked he saw Fenn raise his rifle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t! Don&rsquo;t shoot, Stumpy!&rdquo; called Bart. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
against the law. There&rsquo;s tracking snow!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But it was too late. The stout lad&rsquo;s rifle cracked,
and by the start the buck gave Bart knew his chum
had wounded the animal.</p>

<p>The next instant, after a savage shake of his big
head, with the spreading horns, and a stamping of
his sharp hoofs, the angry animal sprang forward,
straight at Fenn. The lad was excited, and was trying
to pump another cartridge into the chamber, but
the mechanism of his gun had jammed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jump, Fenn! Jump to one side!&rdquo; shouted Bart,
bringing his rifle around. There was no time to
think of the game laws. His chum was in danger,
and he would be justified in shooting.</p>

<p>But before he could fire the buck was upon poor
Fenn. With one sweep of his sharp horns the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
beast swept the lad aside, knocking him down.
Then, with lowered head, the animal tried to gore
the prostrate lad.</p>

<p>Fenn saw his one chance for safety, and took it.
He scrambled up, grabbed the horns, and held on
like grim death. The buck reared, swung around
and tried to strike Fenn with the knife-like hoofs.
Then a curious thing happened. One of the hoofs
went through Fenn&rsquo;s loose belt, and this so tangled
up animal and boy that they both went down in the
snow, and rolled over.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fenn will be killed,&rdquo; gasped Bart, and his heart
almost stopped beating. But the buck struggled to
his feet again, and succeeded in getting his leg free
from the belt. Fenn had again grabbed hold of the
horns of the infuriated animal, which, at that instant
swung around, presenting a good shot to Bart.
Should he fire? Could he hit the buck and not injure
his chum? It was ticklish work, but the need
was great. Bart decided in an instant, took quick
aim and fired.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXV" id="CHAPTER_XXV"></a>CHAPTER XXV</h2>

<h3>NED&rsquo;S RABBIT TRAP</h3>


<p>Bart was using a new kind of powder, and there
was no need to wait for the cloud of smoke to clear
away to see the result of his shot. He beheld, an instant
after the report of his rifle, the big buck swaying
unsteadily. The lad was about to fire again, but
there was no need, for the animal slowly sank to the
snow-covered earth, and fell with a thud.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jump back, Stumpy! Jump back!&rdquo; yelled Bart,
fearing that the heavy animal would crash on top
of Fenn. But, though the stout lad was incapable
of leaping back, he managed to push himself out of
danger, from the hold he had on the horns. Then
he rolled over the snow, now red from the blood of
the buck.</p>

<p>Bart rushed up, with rifle ready for another shot,
but there was no need. His one bullet had struck a
vital spot, and the big animal was breathing his last.
Then Bart turned his attention to his chum.</p>

<p>Fenn was lying curiously white and still upon the
snow, and, as Bart looked, he saw a stream of blood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
coming from under where the lad was stretched out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fenn! Stumpy! Are you hurt?&rdquo; he cried, laying
down his gun, and endeavoring to raise Fenn&rsquo;s head.
As he did so he saw that the lad&rsquo;s wound was in his
arm, where the sharp prongs of the deer had cut a
gash. It was bleeding freely, and Bart knew this
must be stopped.</p>

<p>Not in vain had he listened to his sister&rsquo;s almost
constant talks about first aid to the injured. Bart
recollected some of Alice&rsquo;s instructions, and, a
moment later he was binding up the cut with some
bandages which he had stuck in his pocket with the
idea of using to clean his gun, but which now served
a more useful purpose.</p>

<p>Bart was glad to see that, as he wound the linen
rags around Fenn&rsquo;s arm, the flow of blood ceased.
Then, rubbing the unconscious lad&rsquo;s face with snow,
Bart noted a wave of returning color, and, a moment
later, Fenn opened his eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is anybody hurt?&rdquo; he asked, slowly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the only one&mdash;except the buck,&rdquo; answered
Bart, with a sigh of relief, &ldquo;and you&rsquo;re not
so badly off, I guess, that is, unless you&rsquo;re wounded
some other place besides the arm.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I think that&rsquo;s all. But what happened to
the buck?&rdquo; and Fenn looked around.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There he is,&rdquo; replied Bart, pointing to the dead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
animal. &ldquo;You certainly had nerve to tackle him
by the horns, Stumpy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; was the simple answer. &ldquo;It was
all I could do. It was either that or let him gouge
me, and I didn&rsquo;t want to do that. Did you shoot
him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and it was close work, too, for your head
was almost in the way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you did it!&rdquo; exclaimed Fenn, enthusiastically.
&ldquo;You saved my life, Bart, and&mdash;&rdquo; but Fenn
could say no more. The nervous shock was too
much for him, and he put out his hand and silently
clasped that of his friend.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, it was easy once I made up my mind to fire,&rdquo;
went on Bart. &ldquo;I drew a bead on him, and I thought
of the game laws, but I knew I was justified.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was a corking good shot,&rdquo; exclaimed Fenn,
admiringly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a wonder with the rifle, Bart.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, not so much, I guess. But how about you?
Can you walk?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m all right. I got scared there for a
while, especially when that brute got his leg down
inside my belt. I thought it was all up with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So did I. You shouldn&rsquo;t have fired at him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know it, but I let her go before I thought. I&rsquo;m
done with hunting for a while.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense, you&rsquo;ll be at it again in a few days.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
But, if you can walk, let&rsquo;s get back to camp, and get
the other fellows. Then we&rsquo;ll come after our meat.
We&rsquo;ll have enough venison for a month.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fenn was rapidly recovering from the effects of
his encounter with the buck, though he was still a
trifle shaky. He managed to march along, however,
and it was found that the cut on his arm was
his only injury, except for some bruises and a severe
shaking up.</p>

<p>The boys managed to get the buck on some tree
branches, after Fenn and Bart had returned to camp,
where they found Ned and Frank waiting for them,
and they dragged the carcass over the snow to the
tents. There it was cut up, and hung in trees, out
of the way of foxes, or other prowling beasts.</p>

<p>With enough food in camp for the rest of their
stay, the four chums now took things a little easier,
only going out for occasional game birds. Fenn&rsquo;s
injury seemed to be healing from the effects of the
medical salve put on from the box Alice had provided.</p>

<p>It was one afternoon, three days later, that Ned
was observed to be busy with an empty box, some
big rubber bands, and string.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you up to now?&rdquo; asked Frank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see,&rdquo; was the answer. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know
whether it will work or not, so I&rsquo;m not going to say<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
what it is.&rdquo; A little later Ned started off through
the woods, carrying his contrivance.</p>

<p>His chums were busy about camp, cleaning their
guns, bringing in wood or water, and &ldquo;slicking up&rdquo;
generally, and so paid little attention to Ned. It
wasn&rsquo;t until half an hour afterward that, hearing
startled cries in the woods, from the direction of a
little clearing where rabbits were numerous, that
Bart exclaimed:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Something&rsquo;s happened to Ned! Hurry up!&rdquo;</p>

<p>They ran to the place, and saw a curious sight.
Ned was lying on the snow-covered ground, his
hands stretched toward a sapling while his feet
seemed encased in the box at which he had been
working a short time previous.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; panted Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Get me loose first, and I&rsquo;ll tell you,&rdquo; cried Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you fast?&rdquo; asked Frank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fast? Of course I am! Can&rsquo;t you see for yourself.
I&rsquo;m caught by my hands and feet in some
rabbit traps I was setting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Serves you right,&rdquo; commented Bart, trying not
to laugh. &ldquo;You ought to be a sportsman, and shoot
your game.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want to shoot &rsquo;em,&rdquo; explained Ned. &ldquo;I
wanted to catch &rsquo;em alive and tame &rsquo;em. Hurry up
and get me out; will you, fellows?&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>They soon released him. His feet were caught
under a box, which was weighted down with rocks,
while his hands were held in a slip-noose of heavy
cord that was fast to the tree, which had been bent
over to act as a spring. Ned was stretched out like
a prisoner &ldquo;pegged-out&rdquo; in the army. He was soon
released, and explained that as he was setting the
noose trap, his feet had unexpectedly gotten under
the box trap, which was sprung, and then the noose
slipped, holding him fast at both ends.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXVI"></a>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>

<h3>A VISIT TO TOWN</h3>


<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; remarked Bart, as they walked back to
camp with Ned, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s no use setting any traps
now, Ned. The rabbits were watching you, and they
saw just how they worked, so you couldn&rsquo;t catch the
simplest bunny in these woods.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make another kind of trap,&rdquo; declared Ned.
&ldquo;I want a rabbit to keep Fenn&rsquo;s turtle company.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t bother about it,&rdquo; said Fenn, dryly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because my turtle got away in the night. He
went back to the boiling spring, to join the others
for a New Year&rsquo;s celebration, I guess.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so, to-morrow is the last day of this year,&rdquo;
observed Frank. &ldquo;We ought to celebrate it in some
way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will,&rdquo; said Bart. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll sit up, and watch
the old year out and the new one in, and fire our
guns off at twelve o&rsquo;clock. But what&rsquo;s the matter,
Stumpy?&rdquo; for Fenn was holding the arm injured by
the buck, and on his face was an expression of pain.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been hurting considerable since morning,&rdquo;
explained the stout youth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me look at it,&rdquo; demanded Bart, and, when
the bandages were taken off, there was disclosed a
red and angry sore. The arm was much inflamed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was afraid of this,&rdquo; said Bart. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to
go to town and let a doctor look at this. You may
get blood poisoning, Stumpy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I guess not. Can&rsquo;t you put some of the
stuff on from the box Alice gave us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid to take any chances. Besides, I don&rsquo;t
think there is anything strong enough for blood
poison in the box. No, fellows, we&rsquo;ll go to Cannistota.
It&rsquo;s only ten miles. We can easily walk there
and back in a day, and, if the doctor thinks it better
for Stumpy to stay in town over night, so he can
treat him, why we can arrange for that, too. We&rsquo;ll
start in the morning, early.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ll see some of the celebration,&rdquo; put in
Frank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What celebration?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why the New Year&rsquo;s doings that William Perry
said were always held in Cannistota. Don&rsquo;t you
remember?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure, that&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; agreed Bart. &ldquo;It will do us
good to make the trip. Game is getting rather scarce
around here now, and we must begin to think of getting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
back. We certainly have had a swell time, and
I don&rsquo;t want anything to happen to Fenn&rsquo;s arm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So get ready, fellows, and we&rsquo;ll make a trip to
town, and see what civilization looks like. It seems
as if we&rsquo;d been away six months, instead of three
weeks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shall we take our guns?&rdquo; asked Frank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Might as well. No telling what game we&rsquo;ll see
on our way back, and going in. We&rsquo;ll fix up the
camp so if we have to stay away over night it will be
all right, though I don&rsquo;t imagine any one will bother
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Unless it&rsquo;s that mysterious man,&rdquo; said Ned,
significantly. &ldquo;He may come snooping around.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, if he does we can&rsquo;t help it,&rdquo; replied Bart,
&ldquo;only I&rsquo;d like to catch him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;d like to get back Mrs. Long&rsquo;s diamond
bracelet!&rdquo; exclaimed Frank, with a flash of his dark
eyes. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not pleasant to be considered a thief!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nobody really believes we took it,&rdquo; declared
Fenn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s talk about it,&rdquo; declared Bart.
&ldquo;We will try to have a good time in town&mdash;that is,
if Fenn&rsquo;s arm doesn&rsquo;t get any worse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t believe it will,&rdquo; answered the injured
lad, pluckily. But the sore was very painful.</p>

<p>Preparations for leaving camp were soon under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
way. The chums had an early breakfast the next
morning&mdash;their last breakfast of the year, as Ned
laughingly remarked&mdash;and then, with Fenn&rsquo;s arm
well wrapped up, so he would not take cold in it, and
each of the other lads carrying a gun, they started
off for the town of Cannistota.</p>

<p>The weather was pleasant, though a bit cold, and
the sun was shining brightly on the snow which still
covered the ground. The going at first was heavy,
for it was through the woods, over a trail hard to
discern, but when they struck the lumber road, leading
into Cannistota, the traveling was easier.</p>

<p>They saw no game, save some rabbits, and a few
squirrels, but they would not shoot at these. They
could not make very good time, and it was nearly
noon when they came in sight of the town, which lay
in a valley, surrounded on all sides by hills.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now for the doctor,&rdquo; decided Bart, &ldquo;and then
we&rsquo;ll see what&rsquo;s going on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And get dinner,&rdquo; added Ned, who was fond of
his meals.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; added Frank, who was no less a good
handler of knife and fork.</p>

<p>As the lads entered the main street of the town
they were struck by the festive appearances on every
side. Stores and houses were draped with flags and
bunting, while from several electric-light poles men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
were stringing long wires, with small incandescent
bulbs of various colors fastened on at intervals.
This was in the centre of the place, where the two
main streets crossed, and, on inquiring, the lads
learned that it was planned to hold a sort of procession,
with the Old Year, typified by Father Time,
going out, while the New Year came in. This
formality would occur in the centre of the town,
under a canopy of colored electric lights. In addition
there were to be bands of music, songs, and
other numbers on a festive program.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, we ought to stay and take this in,&rdquo; suggested
Ned, as he saw the carnival spirit manifested on
every side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe we will,&rdquo; assented Bart, &ldquo;after we hear
what the doctor says about Fenn&rsquo;s arm.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The medical man looked grave when he saw the injury
caused by the buck&rsquo;s horn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is nothing to be unduly alarmed about,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;but it is well that you came in time. It
needs attention, and while fresh cool air, such as
you get in camp, is good, I shall have to treat the
wound with antiseptics. You must remain in town
at least three days.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boys were a little dismayed to hear this, but
as they had made tentative plans to be away from
camp if necessary, it did not altogether upset their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
calculations. The doctor gave Fenn some medicine,
dressed the sore, and recommended the lads to a
quiet hotel, to stay while the wound was being looked
after.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll enjoy your visit to Cannistota,&rdquo; the doctor
said with a smile, &ldquo;for we always have a good
time here on New Years. There is plenty of excitement.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boys were soon to find that this was true in
an unusual sense, for they took part in a most exciting
scene.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; remarked Fenn, as they came away from
the office of the medical man, &ldquo;it might be worse.
What&rsquo;ll we do now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s eat,&rdquo; suggested Ned, and they all fell in
with this proposal.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVII" id="CHAPTER_XXVII"></a>CHAPTER XXVII</h2>

<h3>THE MAN WITH THE TURTLE</h3>


<p>The chums took their meal at one of the two
hotels in Cannistota, and, liking the appearance of
the place, which the doctor had recommended, they
made arrangements to stay there for a few days,
during which time Fenn&rsquo;s arm was to receive treatment.
They had adjoining rooms, and, once they
had visited them, and left the few belongings they
had brought from camp, they were ready to go out
into the street again, and watch the preparations being
made to celebrate the advent of the New Year
that night.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know one thing we&rsquo;d better do,&rdquo; remarked
Frank, as they strolled along.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; inquired Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Send telegrams to the folks at home, telling
them where we are, and wishing them good luck for
the New Year.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; exclaimed Fenn, &ldquo;but don&rsquo;t say anything
about my sore arm. My folks might worry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was agreed to, and then each lad wrote his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
own telegram, explaining briefly why he was not in
the woods, the carnival forming a good reason for
the change.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This will be a good plan in case they have any
word to send us,&rdquo; remarked Ned. &ldquo;A telegram will
reach us at the hotel, but it never would at camp.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bart had taken his rifle with him when they left
the hotel, and when his companions joked him about
it, asking him if he expected to see a bear or a deer
in the town, Bart replied:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want to take it to a gunmaker&rsquo;s and get a screw
set in a little deeper,&rdquo; referring to one on the lock
mechanism. &ldquo;It works loose every once in a while,
and now&rsquo;s a good time to have it fixed, when I&rsquo;m not
likely to have a use for the rifle. I intend to do a
lot of hunting when we get back to camp.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As the chums strolled on, they saw, on every side,
more evidences of the carnival spirit. On several
side streets, as well as on the main ones, flags and
bunting were in evidence, and colored electric lights
were being strung. Linemen were high up on poles
arranging extra wires, and others, below, were passing
up the colored bulbs, or pliers, and other tools
needed by their mates on the high poles. The boys
watched this for some time, and then, at Bart&rsquo;s suggestion,
they strolled toward the centre of the village.</p>

<p>There a still busier scene was observed. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
were a number of linemen on the tall poles, and, as
the boys looked on, the current was turned into the
hundreds of various-hued bulbs, to test them. It
was early afternoon, and much yet remained to be
done in order to get the decorations completed.</p>

<p>The lads found a gunsmith in his shop, not far
from the intersection of the main streets, and he was
soon at work on Bart&rsquo;s rifle, talking as he worked.
The boys told him of their experience in camp, and
the necessity for their visit to town.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Got scratched by a buck; eh?&rdquo; remarked the old
gunsmith as he gazed from under his bushy white
eyebrows at the lads. &ldquo;That happened to me once.
Their horns seem to sort of poison a wound. I guess
it&rsquo;s because the critters rub their antlers up against
all sorts of trees and bushes. They get poisonous
juices on &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Soon the lads were again strolling along the street.
The afternoon was passing, and presently the town,
which was now thronged with visitors, would be in
the full sway of the carnival.</p>

<p>Fenn was walking ahead of his chums, looking in
the store windows, and taking care that he did not
collide with persons in the crowd, and so injure his
sore arm. The stout youth saw, just ahead of him,
an establishment devoted to the sale of pets of various
kinds. There were pigeons, white rats, puppies,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
gold fish, some monkeys and parrots, and scores of
canary birds. As several specimens were on exhibition
in the windows quite a crowd was gathered
about watching the antics of a pair of monkeys.
Fenn, always interested in such things, drew closer,
motioning to his chums, who were walking slowly,
to join him.</p>

<p>As he turned back toward the store he saw a man
entering&mdash;a man, at the sight of whom, the stout lad
started, and looked at him again, more sharply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder if it can be&mdash;yes, it&rsquo;s the same man&mdash;the
mysterious man we&rsquo;ve been after so long!&rdquo; murmured
Fenn. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s going in that store! I hope he
didn&rsquo;t see me.&rdquo; He got behind a couple of men who
were close to the window, and watched until he had
seen the person he had observed close the door, after
entering the store. Then Fenn turned to address his
chums who were now at his side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; asked Bart, laughing. &ldquo;You
look as if you had seen a ghost, Stumpy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen something more substantial than a
ghost,&rdquo; replied the lad, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen the man who stole
the diamond bracelet, fellows!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo; gasped Ned and Frank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hush! Not so loud,&rdquo; cautioned Fenn, for several
persons were curiously observing the four lads.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s in that store,&rdquo; went on the stout youth.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<p>They could hardly believe him, but Fenn soon told
them the circumstances, and repeated his belief in
the positiveness of his identification. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure it
was the same man,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ll soon see,&rdquo; declared Bart. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll have
to come out, some time or other, and then we can
tell. We&rsquo;ll just wait here a while.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A little later they were all startled to see the man,
about whom there seemed to be such a mystery, come
hurriedly from the store.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There he is!&rdquo; exclaimed Fenn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s him, all right,&rdquo; assented Bart, in low tones.
&ldquo;Now what shall we do; follow him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man turned south on the main street, and began
walking rapidly away. At that instant Fenn
caught sight of a package in his hand. It was a
paper bundle, but, as the stout lad looked, he saw
projecting from it the long, snake-like neck of a mud
turtle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s got a turtle!&rdquo; cried Fenn, excitedly. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s
chase after him! We must solve this mystery now
or never!&rdquo;</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVIII" id="CHAPTER_XXVIII"></a>CHAPTER XXVIII</h2>

<h3>THE PURSUIT</h3>


<p>Fenn darted forward, and would have taken after
the man on the run, only Bart put forth a restraining
hand. Fenn looked at his chum in surprise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Easy, Stumpy,&rdquo; murmured the tall lad, as he
drew his fleshier companion out of hearing of the
crowd in front of the animal store. &ldquo;Do you want
to give the whole thing away? Several times we&rsquo;ve
lost trace of this man because we were in such a rush,
and I don&rsquo;t want it to happen again. You nearly
spoiled everything, Stumpy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; faltered Fenn, &ldquo;but I want to get at
him, and have him explain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So do we all,&rdquo; went on Bart, &ldquo;but we can do it
better by going slow and easy. He hasn&rsquo;t seen us,
and we can trail him and see where he goes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you notice what he had in the paper?&rdquo; asked
the fat lad excitedly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What was it?&rdquo; asked Frank, who had not caught
Fenn&rsquo;s first exclamation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A mud turtle. That&rsquo;s what he got in the store.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, you had better talk lower,&rdquo; cautioned Frank,
for Fenn had spoken loudly. &ldquo;People in the crowd
are beginning to notice us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I guess there&rsquo;s no danger,&rdquo; decided Bart.
&ldquo;There are lots of strangers in town to-day, and we
won&rsquo;t attract much attention. But we must take
after this fellow. We&rsquo;ll trail him carefully now.
He&rsquo;s still on this side of the street, and he&rsquo;s going
slowly,&rdquo; Bart announced, after taking an observation
over the heads of the crowd still in front of the store
window. &ldquo;Fenn and I will take this side of the
street, and you and Ned can take the other side,
Frank. If either of us miss our man we&rsquo;ll meet later
at the hotel. Go ahead now, and keep out of his
sight. Go slow, as if you were only looking at the
sights, but keep your eye on the man. We&rsquo;ll try and
find where he belongs, who he is, and why he collects
turtles.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Through the crowds that were constantly increasing
in size the four lads threaded their ways, two on
one side of the street, and two on the other. Ahead
of them was the mysterious man. He seemed to
have no idea that he was being followed, and appeared
only to be looking at the sights. At times the
boys found difficulty in keeping within the proper
distance of him, and once Ned and Frank lost him,
but they soon picked him up again, and kept on. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
wore a light-colored cap, which made him conspicuous
in the press of people.</p>

<p>The man seemed to be in no hurry to get anywhere.
He strolled leisurely along, looking in store
windows, or pausing to observe the linemen stringing
the wires. The boys were after him, and their
experience in the woods, trailing game, now served
them in good stead. Though they looked carefully,
they could not see any package in the man&rsquo;s hand
now, and they wondered what he had done with the
turtle.</p>

<p>The pursuit led to the outskirts of the town, and,
as the streets became less congested there was danger
of the boys being detected in their chase, but fortunately
for them the man took a notion to swing
down through a side street and retrace his steps,
back toward the centre. Then the pursuit was rendered
less likely to be observed.</p>

<p>Reaching the middle of the town the man paused
to look at a lineman who was on top of a particularly
tall pole, making some final adjustments to the wires
and lamps. As the boys halted, not to come too close
to their quarry, they saw the lineman signal to have
the current turned on. The lamps glowed, but something
seemed to be wrong, for he called for the
power to be turned off while he adjusted a switch.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
There seemed to be some delay over cutting off the
current, and the lineman waited.</p>

<p>The crowd was thicker near the pole, and, not
wishing to let the mysterious man escape, Bart and
Fenn, who were on the same side of the street as
he was, drew nearer to him in the throng. Frank
and Ned were on the other side of the street. The
former chums could observe the object of their
pursuit more closely now. He did not seem to be a
hardened character, but on the contrary, his face
was refined, and his manner seemed gentle, though
there was a curious, cunning air about him.</p>

<p>While the lineman on the tall pole was waiting for
some of his fellow workmen to change the switch,
he looked down into the press of people. He seemed
to recognize some one, and waved his hand. To the
surprise of Bart and Fenn the mysterious man waved
back to the man on the pole.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you see that?&rdquo; exclaimed Fenn, and in his
excitement he had spoken aloud. The next instant
he regretted it, for the man, turning, saw him. He
gave a start of surprise, and then a look of fear
seemed to come over his face. He gave one glance
up at the lineman on his tall perch, waved what
seemed to be a farewell, and darted away through
the crowd.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;After him, Stumpy!&rdquo; whispered Bart, excitedly.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll get away, I&rsquo;m afraid!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The lads started to make their way out of the
throng of people who were all about them. The
mysterious man, too, was at this same disadvantage.</p>

<p>Suddenly, amid the stillness that seemed to settle
over the crowd, as they watched the lineman reach
far over to make a distant connection, there sounded
a cry of fear and pain. High up in the air there
was a flash of bluish fire, a sizzling, as of red-hot iron
plunged into water, and then a shower of sparks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The lineman! The lineman!&rdquo; screamed several.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s on a live wire!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Pausing in their efforts to get out of the crowd,
and take up the pursuit, Bart and Fenn saw the lineman
leaning over in a dangerous position. He was
in a net-work of wires, and all about him seemed to
be long, forked tongues of blue flame, while vicious
sparks shot from one wire to the other. The unfortunate
man had caught hold of the outer end of a
cross-arm on the pole, and, while his feet were on
one lower down, he was thus held in this strained
position. Around his waist was a leather belt, passed
about the pole, and this also retained him in position.</p>

<p>His cry of alarm had brought several other linemen
to the foot of the pole.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you shocked, George?&rdquo; called one, anxiously.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; came the faint reply, &ldquo;not yet, but something
has gone wrong. One of the wires has broken,
and has charged all the others. I&rsquo;m safe as long as I
lean over this way, but I can&rsquo;t get back, and I can&rsquo;t
get down.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Unhook your belt and slide down,&rdquo; suggested
one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t. If I let go with my hands I&rsquo;ll come up
against the wires carrying the main current, and, if
I do&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he did not finish, but they all knew what
he meant.</p>

<p>The crowd was horror-struck. The man was in
the midst of death. He could not move to come
down, for fear of coming in contact with wires,
which, though previously harmless, were now dangerous
because the broken conductor, carrying a
heavy charge, had fallen over them, making them
deadly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hold on, and I&rsquo;ll come up to you!&rdquo; shouted a
lineman, preparing to ascend the pole.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; cried the unfortunate man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have the current cut off at the power house!&rdquo;
yelled a voice in the crowd below.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes! That&rsquo;s the thing to do!&rdquo; echoed a score of
others.</p>

<p>A man ran out of the crowd to the telephone&mdash;the
same telephone over which word had been sent to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
the power station to turn the power on for the preliminary
test. In a few seconds central had given
the frantic man the main electrical station.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cut off the power&mdash;cut off the power!&rdquo; he cried.
&ldquo;One of the linemen on the pole is in danger of being
shocked to death.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Anxiously he waited for the reply. None came.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ring again, central!&rdquo; he called frantically. Over
the wire he heard the distant ringing of the bell in
the power station. The delay seemed like an hour,
though it was only a few seconds.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t they answer? Why don&rsquo;t they answer?&rdquo;
cried the man desperately. &ldquo;Ring &rsquo;em again,
central. Ring hard!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am ringing hard,&rdquo; responded central. &ldquo;There
doesn&rsquo;t seem to be any one there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There must be!&rdquo; insisted the man. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a matter
of life and death! The current must be shut
off!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He waited, moving about nervously, while holding
the receiver to his ear. Those near him could
not imagine what was the trouble. Then came a
click in the receiver that showed that some one was
at the other end of the wire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello! Hello!&rdquo; cried the man who was trying
to have the power cut off. &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you answer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
before. Why don&rsquo;t you shut off the current?
There&rsquo;s a man being killed&mdash;what&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He fairly yelled the last words, and those near
him saw a look of horror spread over his face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;The electrician has
stepped out you say? What? He thought the power
was to be left on? Oh! He&rsquo;ll be back in five
minutes? But that will be too late. Can&rsquo;t you&mdash;hold
on there&mdash;don&rsquo;t go away&mdash;what&rsquo;s that&mdash;yes, I
hear you but&mdash;don&rsquo;t go away&mdash;do something&mdash;pull
out the switch&mdash;do something&mdash;never mind the electrician&mdash;you
do it&mdash;don&rsquo;t go away&mdash;don&rsquo;t go away&mdash;Ah&mdash;it&rsquo;s
too late!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He turned to those standing near him at the telephone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The only electrician now at the power station
stepped out after turning on the current,&rdquo; the man
explained dully, as he hung up the receiver. &ldquo;There
was some mistake. He thought the wiring was finished,
and that the power was to remain turned on.
So he went out, and he left a green man in charge,
who doesn&rsquo;t know anything about the engines, or
dynamos. This man said he&rsquo;d run out and get the
electrician. I tried to stop him&mdash;tried to make him
understand that he, himself, must do something&mdash;must
shut off the current&mdash;but I couldn&rsquo;t get it
through his head. He dropped the telephone, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
ran out after the electrician. Now there&rsquo;s no way of
shutting off the power until the engineer gets back,
and, by that time&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; He paused significantly, and
rushed out. Nothing more could be done at the telephone.
It was as if the wire was broken.</p>

<p>Up on his high perch the lineman was becoming
weaker from the strain, and the fear of death. He
looked down at the crowd below. Bart and Fenn
gazed upward. How they wished they could help!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that man&mdash;that mysterious man gone?&rdquo; asked
Bart, in low tones.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Fenn, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s hurrying down the
street. We&rsquo;d better take after him, if we want to
catch him. He&rsquo;s getting to be very suspicious of us.
We ought to catch him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know it. If we could only signal Ned or Frank
we might run some chance&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>At that moment another lineman, standing near
Bart, turned to him, and asked excitedly, as he saw
the rifle in the lad&rsquo;s hand:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you a good shot? A man&rsquo;s life may depend
on it! Can you shoot straight?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pretty straight,&rdquo; answered Bart, wondering what
was coming next. The lineman was excited, he approached
nearer to Bart, and motioned to his friend
high up on the pole&mdash;the man from whom death
seemed but a short distance away.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Is your rifle loaded? Then, if it is, for mercy
sakes fire and see if you can sever that main feed
wire,&rdquo; and the lineman pointed to a thick conductor,
which was shooting out blue sparks, and which had
charged all the other wires with the deadly current.
&ldquo;See if you can cut that wire,&rdquo; went on the lineman
eagerly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the only chance to save his life!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bart hesitated. He turned to see the man whom
they had pursued, making his escape. If he got away
it might mean that they would never see him again&mdash;never
have the theft of the diamond bracelet solved.
It was a choice between the honor of the Darewell
Chums and the life of a man. Which would Bart
choose?</p>

<p>There could be but one answer to this question.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIX" id="CHAPTER_XXIX"></a>CHAPTER XXIX</h2>

<h3>BART&rsquo;S BEST SHOT</h3>


<p>Bart turned to Fenn. He was just about to
whisper to his chum to take up the pursuit of the
mysterious man, leaving him to attempt a difficult
shot to save the life of the lineman, but at that instant
there was a swaying in the crowd, and a boy
stumbled up against Fenn&rsquo;s sore arm. The injured
lad uttered a cry of pain. His face turned white,
and he was struggling to stay on his feet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Catch him! He&rsquo;s going to faint!&rdquo; cried some
one, and faint poor Fenn did, being caught in the
arms of two men.</p>

<p>Bart felt his brain reeling, but, by a strong effort
he held himself together.</p>

<p>There was now no chance of continuing the pursuit
of the mysterious man. Fenn was being carried
to a place where he could be cared for. It was impossible
to communicate with Ned and Frank, who
were on the other side of the street, and Bart could
not go away and leave the man on the pole to die.
There was no help for it. He must stay and try, by
a most difficult shot, to sever the dangerous wire.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you do it? Can you do it?&rdquo; asked the lineman
who had proposed the extreme measure to the
lad. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the only chance. Can you cut that wire?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think so,&rdquo; was the quiet answer. No one in
that crowd knew under what a strain Bart Keene
was at that moment. No one associated the now unconscious
Fenn with him, and no one dreamed that
Bart was anxious to continue after a man who he
believed to be a criminal, and who was fast making
his escape.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you hold on a minute longer, George?&rdquo;
called a workman on the ground, up to the lineman
on the pole.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; came back the faint answer, &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s hard
work. Can&rsquo;t you shut off the current? If I make a
move I&rsquo;m a goner. Can&rsquo;t you turn off the current?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to try to cut the wire,&rdquo; went on the
man who had thought of the plan. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t get
the current shut off right away. Listen carefully,
George. Hold as still as you can. There&rsquo;s a lad
here with a rifle. He&rsquo;s a good shot, he says, and he&rsquo;s
going to fire at the live wire until he cuts it. It&rsquo;s
going to be a close shave for you, as the wire is
pretty near to your head. Have you nerve enough
to stand it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I guess so,&rdquo; came the hesitating answer. &ldquo;Go
ahead!&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<p>The crowd below was scarcely breathing. The
man on the pole could be seen straining himself to
maintain his perilous position. He looked down.
Death was below him, and on every side, and none
dare climb the pole to help him. The rifle seemed
the only chance, unless some one could go five miles
to the power house, and have the current turned off,
or unless the electrician returned, and this would take
so long that the man&rsquo;s hold would loosen, and he
would either fall, or be shocked to death. It all depended
on Bart, and the lad knew that he must now
shoot true, if he never shot straight again. It was
to be his best shot&mdash;a well-nigh tragic shot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Clear a space for the lad!&rdquo; ordered the lineman,
as he and his fellows began making a circle about
Bart. &ldquo;Give him room. Have you got plenty of cartridges,
young man?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bart nodded. He felt that he could not speak, and
he knew that the chamber of his rifle was filled. Yet
he hoped to do the trick with only one bullet.</p>

<p>The shot was a hard one. He must cut a wire
within four inches of the shoulder of the man whose
life he was trying to save, and he had to fire upward,
and at a slightly swaying target&mdash;a target
small enough at best, hardly more than half an inch
wide. Yet Bart did not hesitate.</p>

<p>He took his position under the wires, and close to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
the pole. The crowd was looking eagerly on, and the
man on the pole was like a statue. Well he knew
how much depended on his remaining motionless.</p>

<p>Bart raised his rifle. A mist seemed to come before
his eyes, but with a gritting of his teeth he got
more control of himself, and then he saw clear. He
took careful aim, and then he saw that he could shoot
to more advantage from the other side of the pole.
He would have to fire closer to the man, but the
bullet would take an outward slant in cutting the
wire, and there was less danger of it glancing off
and wounding the lineman.</p>

<p>The lad changed his position, and once more took
careful aim. He took a long breath, and his finger
began to tighten on the trigger. At that instant there
came a puff of wind, and the wire at which he was
aiming swayed toward the unfortunate man. There
was a cry of horror, and several persons in the crowd
started toward Bart, as if to stop the firing of the
gun. But the lad was on the alert, and waited until
the wire was still again.</p>

<p>One, two, three seconds passed. Would he never
fire? Suddenly those watching him saw his figure
stiffen. He braced the rifle more firmly against his
shoulder. There was a further tightening of the
tension of his trigger finger, and a report that seemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
to the nervous crowd to be as loud as a cannon
vibrated on the wintry air.</p>

<p>An instant later there came tumbling from aloft
a long wire, that writhed about like some snake,
spitting blue flames and sparks. It wiggled about on
the ground as a thing alive.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Keep back! Keep back from that wire!&rdquo; shouted
a lineman. &ldquo;Good shot, my lad! Great! You cut
the wire with one bullet!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bart lowered his gun. Once more the mist seemed
to come before his eyes, but it did not matter now,
for he had saved the man. Yet no one ever knew
how narrow was the margin, for, as Bart was pulling
the trigger, the wire was once more swayed by the
wind, and the bullet from the rifle had sped past the
man&rsquo;s head less than two inches away. So close had
he been to death! But Bart had shot true, and, ever,
in after years, he called that his best shot.</p>

<p>A cheer went up from the crowd at the plucky act
of the lad, but it was quickly hushed as one of the
linemen began to climb the pole, to assist down his
comrade who had had such a narrow escape. He
was too unnerved to descend alone, but there was
no more danger, for the live wire was out of the
way, and other linemen, with insulated gloves, soon
had it in its proper place.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXX" id="CHAPTER_XXX"></a>CHAPTER XXX</h2>

<h3>THE DIAMOND BRACELET&mdash;CONCLUSION</h3>


<p>Bart turned to make his way out of the crowd,
for he was anxious about Fenn. He had given up all
hope of capturing the mysterious man, who had
started to hasten away before the accident to the
lineman on the pole, and who, doubtless, was far
enough off by this time. But Bart&rsquo;s progress was arrested
by a voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hold on, young fellow!&rdquo; exclaimed the workman
whose life Bart had saved. &ldquo;I want to shake
hands with you. That was a corking good shot. I
heard the bullet whistle past me, and then I knew I
was safe. Shake!&rdquo; and he extended his hand that
did not tremble as much as did Bart&rsquo;s, such nerve
did the electrician have. He had fully recovered
from his thrilling experience.</p>

<p>Bart received modestly the almost extravagant
praise accorded him, and once more began to make
his way toward where Fenn had been carried.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is my chum?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;The lad who
fainted.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;s coming around all right,&rdquo; answered a
man. At that moment Fenn himself came through
the press of people around Bart. He had recovered
from the shock caused by the sudden pressure on his
sore arm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you all right?&rdquo; asked Bart, anxiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure. How about you?&rdquo; inquired Stumpy. &ldquo;I
hear you made a great shot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk about it,&rdquo; pleaded Bart, who was now
almost as nervous as a girl. &ldquo;Where are Ned and
Frank?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Following that man, I suppose,&rdquo; began Fenn, and
then he stopped suddenly, for people looked curiously
at him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, we must look them up,&rdquo; went on Bart, but
he felt that a further chase would be useless.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, you fellows aren&rsquo;t going to disappear until
you do me a favor,&rdquo; began the rescued lineman, good
naturedly. &ldquo;I want you to come to my house, and
meet my wife. She&rsquo;ll want to know the boy who
saved me from a horrible death. It isn&rsquo;t far,&rdquo; he
added, as he saw Bart was about to decline. &ldquo;Please
come. I&rsquo;m not going to work any more to-day. I&rsquo;m
too shaky.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They saw that it would not be kind to refuse, and
the electrician led the way for Bart and Fenn through
the crowd, who parted with murmurs of admiration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
for the lad who had made such a plucky shot. There
was no sign of Ned or Frank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know how to begin to thank you,&rdquo;
said the man, feelingly, when they were in a somewhat
secluded place on the main street. The work
of preparing for the ushering in of the New Year
was almost completed. &ldquo;I never <i>can</i> properly thank
you,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;My name&rsquo;s George Lang, and if
ever you boys want a friend, or if you want anything
done in the line business, you call for George,&rdquo; and
he meant what he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad I was able to fire, and sever the wire,&rdquo;
said Bart, as he walked along with Mr. Lang, &ldquo;but
I wish it had happened a few minutes earlier&mdash;or
later,&rdquo; he added.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry it happened at all,&rdquo; declared Mr. Lang.
&ldquo;I never had an accident like that, and I don&rsquo;t want
another. But what difference did the time make?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because we were on the trail of a thief,&rdquo; explained
Bart, &ldquo;and he skipped out just before you
got caught on top of the pole. He was a chap who
had stolen a diamond bracelet, and we boys are accused
of the crime. We wanted to capture him to
prove our innocence. My two chums are after
him, but I don&rsquo;t believe they&rsquo;ll catch him. He saw
us and skipped out. By the way,&rdquo; the lad added, as
he recollected the incident, &ldquo;he waved his hand to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
you, and you waved back to him from the top of
the pole, just before the wire broke loose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Me?&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Lang in great astonishment.
&ldquo;I waved to a diamond-bracelet thief?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t say you knew him,&rdquo; declared Bart, fearing
he had been misunderstood, &ldquo;but you certainly
greeted him. He had on a light cap, and he stood at
the foot of the pole, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Him? Oh, you mean him&mdash;that&mdash;why&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; the
lineman seemed to be choking&mdash;&ldquo;a thief&mdash;stole a
diamond bracelet&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; He had to stop to catch his
breath, but whether it was from laughter, or because
he choked, the lads could not decide. &ldquo;Him a thief?&rdquo;
asked Mr. Lang.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Or, if he didn&rsquo;t take the bracelet, he took the
professor&rsquo;s mud turtle,&rdquo; put in Fenn, who had by
this time recovered from his indisposition.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mud turtle! Oh, dear! Mud turtles, you say?
Oh, I&mdash;excuse me,&rdquo; and again the lineman choked
up. &ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; he said at length. &ldquo;I know
who you mean. Would you like to meet him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Would we?&rdquo; gasped Bart and Fenn, together.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s enough. I&rsquo;ll guarantee to introduce you
to him, if he&rsquo;s at home,&rdquo; went on Mr. Lang. &ldquo;He
lives next door to me. I know him well. A diamond
thief! Oh, dear! Mud turtles!&rdquo; and again the lineman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
seemed overcome. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say another word,
but come on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Much mystified, Bart and Fenn followed their
friend. He led them up a quiet street, and into a
neat cottage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mary,&rdquo; he said to his wife, when he had introduced
the lads, &ldquo;one of these boys saved my life this
afternoon, but I&rsquo;ll tell you more about that later.
Just now I&rsquo;ve something else on hand. Do you
know if William is home?&rdquo; and he nodded at the
house next door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Mrs. Lang, wonderingly, &ldquo;he just
came in. I think he brought home another turtle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The hearts of Fenn and Bart gave jumps! At
last they were on the trail!</p>

<p>Without a word the lineman led the way to the
adjoining house. He seemed to be laboring under
some emotion, as if he was trying hard not to laugh.
He knocked at the door, and a man answered the
summons. Bart and Fenn started back. There
stood the mysterious person who had eluded them
so often&mdash;the man they believed had taken the diamond
bracelet belonging to the professor&rsquo;s wife!
On his part the mysterious individual seemed anxious
to run away at the sight of Bart and Fenn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;William,&rdquo; began the lineman, &ldquo;one of these lads
saved my life a while ago. Now don&rsquo;t get excited&mdash;take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
things calmly. No one is going to hurt you, or
your turtles,&rdquo; and he spoke almost as he might to a
child, or to a sick person. &ldquo;I just want to introduce
you to these boys. They are looking for a diamond
bracelet, and they think maybe you could help them
find it. Boys, this is my cousin, William Lang,&rdquo; and
Bart thought the lineman winked significantly at
him. Was there more to the mystery?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your cousin?&rdquo; echoed Fenn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered the man whose life Bart had
saved. &ldquo;He is one of the greatest collectors of
turtles in the world,&rdquo; and again he winked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I am!&rdquo; exclaimed William Lang,
proudly, and he seemed to lose some of his fear.
Still Bart could not help thinking that his manner
was very strange. &ldquo;But I haven&rsquo;t any diamond
bracelet,&rdquo; went on the odd individual. &ldquo;I know you
boys think I have it, and you&rsquo;ve been chasing me
for it, and trying to have me arrested, but I haven&rsquo;t
got it. I tried to keep out of your way, but I
couldn&rsquo;t seem to. You were always after me, even
when I was only collecting turtles. I know about
the bracelet, though.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you know about it?&rdquo; asked Bart,
eagerly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, I read in the papers that it was stolen,&rdquo;
said William Lang, simply. &ldquo;It was taken the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
night I went to the school to look at Professor
Long&rsquo;s turtles. He didn&rsquo;t want me to see &rsquo;em, but
I did all right. I got in when he wasn&rsquo;t there, and
fooled him. He was so mysterious about &rsquo;em, that
I thought he had a rare kind. But he didn&rsquo;t have at
all. Anyway I saw &rsquo;em, and he doesn&rsquo;t know it,
even to this day. I got in at the dead of night,&rdquo; and
the man&rsquo;s voice sunk to a whisper, and his face took
on a cunning look.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then <i>you</i> were the man we saw enter the school
that night!&rdquo; exclaimed Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you see me? Did you see me?&rdquo; gasped the
lineman&rsquo;s cousin, in great alarm. &ldquo;Oh, yes, I remember
now, I ran!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure we saw you,&rdquo; answered Fenn. &ldquo;We
were&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bart gave his chum a warning look.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean any harm,&rdquo; cried William Lang.
&ldquo;I only went in to see the turtles. I&rsquo;m a great collector
of them,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;I heard about Professor
Long&rsquo;s collection, and once I called on him at the
school. I wanted to see his reptiles, but for some
reason he wouldn&rsquo;t let me. But I made up my mind
I <i>would</i> see &rsquo;em. I knew he was trying to deceive
me&mdash;Professor Long was&mdash;so one night I took a
false key I had, and I got in the school. I had a
dark lantern and I saw the turtles. I got ahead of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
Professor Long that time,&rdquo; and the man laughed excitedly.
&ldquo;But come in, and I&rsquo;ll show you my collection,&rdquo;
he added.</p>

<p>He turned into the house, and the two boys, after
a moment of hesitation, followed. They did not yet
quite understand. The lineman whispered to them,
when out of earshot of his cousin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must humor poor William,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;He
is all right except on the subject of mud turtles. He
thinks he has the greatest collection of them in the
world. I don&rsquo;t in the least doubt that he went in the
school by stealth to look at some. In fact, I heard
from Professor Long about a visit he paid to him
one day, when he wanted to see the school collection.
Professor Long had heard of my cousin, and knew
him to be harmless, but William got so excited on
the subject of turtles that the professor concluded
it would not be best to exhibit the school collection,
so he refused. This made William suspicious, and
very likely he made up his mind to sneak in, and get
a night-view of the reptiles. I have no doubt but
that he did so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He certainly did,&rdquo; answered Bart. &ldquo;We saw him
come out. Then, when the diamond bracelet was
missed, we naturally concluded that he was the
person who had taken it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The lineman shook his head.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;William would not do such a thing,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;There must be some other explanation. But humor
him now by looking at his turtles. You may get a
clew.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boys did so. The eccentric man, who was
somewhat insane on the subject of turtles, had quite
a collection of the queer reptiles&mdash;larger even than
Fenn&rsquo;s, or the one in the High School. He talked
of them interestedly. By degrees Bart led to the
subject of his visit to the school, and touched on the
diamond bracelet, but the man&rsquo;s replies showed that
he knew nothing of it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I remember you boys,&rdquo; William Lang went on.
&ldquo;I recollect now that I saw you as I hurried away
from the school, and I thought you would chase me,
but you didn&rsquo;t. Then I saw you in the shooting
gallery, but I didn&rsquo;t know you at first. I&rsquo;m a fine
shot, you know, but I couldn&rsquo;t shoot well that night,
after I recognized you,&rdquo; and he nodded at Bart.
&ldquo;By this time I had learned of the missing bracelet,
and I was afraid you might have me arrested for
taking it, so I hurried away. But I never saw it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He paused to replace in the cage a turtle that was
crawling out, and the lineman took occasion to say in
a whisper:</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s another of William&rsquo;s odd notions. He
thinks he is a crack rifle shot.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, he did shoot pretty well,&rdquo; said Bart. &ldquo;But
I am wondering where on earth the bracelet can be.
We are all at sea again, over it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would have more turtles if a certain Fenn
Masterson had sold me his collection,&rdquo; went on the
queer man. &ldquo;I got his name from a naturalist&rsquo;s
magazine, for he collects turtles, it seems. I wrote
to Mr. Masterson, asking him if he&rsquo;d sell me his
turtles. But I had to proceed very cautiously, for he
lived in the same town where the bracelet was
stolen, and I didn&rsquo;t want to show myself there. So
I told him to leave his answer in an old sycamore
tree. Then, after I did that I became alarmed, and
I didn&rsquo;t dare go back to see if he had replied. Oh,
you can&rsquo;t be too careful in this business,&rdquo; concluded
the man, with a cunning look.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, <i>I&rsquo;m</i> that Fenn Masterson!&rdquo; exclaimed the
owner of the name.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you?&rdquo; demanded William Lang. &ldquo;Will you
sell me your turtles?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; replied Fenn, who had rather lost
interest in his collection, of late. &ldquo;You can have
them. We hid and waited to see if you would call
for an answer to your letter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess that&rsquo;s some more of poor William&rsquo;s
imagination,&rdquo; remarked the lineman in a low voice.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
&ldquo;Leaving a letter in a sycamore tree, and all that sort
of thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, that part&rsquo;s true enough,&rdquo; declared Bart.
&ldquo;We waited for some time in a storm for him to
show up, but he never did. Oh, it&rsquo;s true enough. I
am beginning to understand some things now. The
reason why your cousin ran away from us so often
was because of the notion he had that we wanted to
arrest him. We would never have harmed him had
we known.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo; agreed the lineman, he and Bart
having talked in whispers while the turtle collector
was exhibiting some odd specimens to Fenn. William
Lang told of his visit to Oak Swamp, and how
he had fled at the sight of the boys, fearing they
wanted to cause his arrest, and he also mentioned his
trips to the mud volcano, and how he had run away
at the sound of some one stirring in the campers&rsquo;
tent, likewise how he had led the boys a chase about
the town, just prior to the accident on the pole.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But about the bracelet, I don&rsquo;t know a thing,&rdquo;
concluded William Lang.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, and I think he tells the truth,&rdquo; added the
lineman, in a low voice. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, but you boys
will have to keep on with your search.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It needed but a glance at the simple face of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
turtle collector to show that he was not a thief, even
if he was a decidedly peculiar individual.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; remarked Bart, after a pause, &ldquo;I guess all
Fenn and I can do is to go back to the hotel, and
wait for Ned and Frank to show up.&rdquo; The two
turned to leave the turtle collector&rsquo;s house. William
Lang was busy inspecting his queer pets, and seemed
to pay no further attention to his visitors.</p>

<p>&ldquo;William was always a little queer,&rdquo; remarked
the lineman, as he accompanied the boys outside.
&ldquo;Harmless, but odd. Just daffy on the mud turtle
question. I don&rsquo;t wonder he gave you lots to think
about, or that you didn&rsquo;t quite know how to take
him. He is all right except on turtles. He&rsquo;d walk
fifty miles to get a new one. But he&rsquo;s well off, and
can afford to indulge in his fancy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As Bart and Fenn turned into the street they saw,
coming toward them, Ned and Frank. Ned was
frantically waving a paper in the air.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;d you find your way here?&rdquo; called Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;People in the crowd told us you&rsquo;d come here,&rdquo;
replied Frank. &ldquo;But have you heard the good
news?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What good news?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The diamond bracelet wasn&rsquo;t stolen at all!&rdquo; burst
out Ned. &ldquo;We just got telegrams from home. They
were at the hotel waiting for us. We went there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
after missing you in the crowd, when something happened
on the top of the pole. We tried to follow
that mysterious man, but we missed him. There are
also telegrams for you two fellows. I thought you
had them, or&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For gracious sake tell us the good news! What
about the diamond bracelet?&rdquo; yelled Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been found!&rdquo; exploded Ned. &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t
stolen at all. It had fallen down a crack in the
cabinet, in Professor Long&rsquo;s room, and a snake was
taking his winter sleep over the crack. Yesterday
the snake died, Mr. Long took it out&mdash;and found
the bracelet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll be jiggered!&rdquo; exclaimed Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should say it was good news,&rdquo; declared Fenn.
&ldquo;This takes suspicion from the Darewell Chums.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Two days later the boys returned to their winter
camp, and, after nearly a month spent in the forest,
they packed up, walked in to Cannistota, sent a teamster
back for their goods, and took a train for home.</p>

<p>The lads arrived at their home-town at dusk. Jed
Sneed was at the station to meet them.</p>

<p>A little later the four chums were in their respective
houses, telling of their adventures to their
eager parents&mdash;there was considerable to tell.</p>

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
